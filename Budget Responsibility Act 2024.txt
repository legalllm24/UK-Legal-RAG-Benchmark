If a Minister of the Crown is proposing to make a fiscal announcement to the House of Commons in respect of—
(a)
a measure which is fiscally significant, or
(b)
two or more measures where any combination of the measures is fiscally significant,
the Treasury must, before the announcement, request the Office to prepare a section 4(3) report that takes account of the measure or measures.
(2)
If, in the case of a measure in respect of which a request was required to be made in accordance with subsection (1) and in respect of which no such request has been made, the Office is of the opinion that the measure (either alone or in combination with other such measures) is fiscally significant, the Office must as soon as is reasonably practicable—
(a)
notify the Treasury Committee of the House of Commons of its opinion, and
(b)
prepare a report that includes a costing for the measure (which may, but need not, be a section 4(3) report).
(3)
A measure or combination of measures is “fiscally significant” if the measure, or combination of measures, has a costing for a specified period that exceeds a specified percentage of the gross domestic product for a specified period.
“Specified” means specified in, or determined in accordance with, the Charter for Budget Responsibility.
