Unitedkingdom,"An employee in England is currently on maternity leave under the Employment Rights Act 1996. During her leave, her employer announces a redundancy process due to company restructuring. Additionally, there are health and safety concerns at the workplace that might affect her return. Considering the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (as amended), the Equality Act 2010, the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, and relevant case law, what protections does she have during redundancy, and how should the employer proceed?","Under the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999, specifically Regulation 10, if an employee on maternity leave is at risk of redundancy, she must be offered any suitable alternative vacancy available before it is offered to other employees, giving her priority for redeployment opportunities. The Equality Act 2010, particularly Section 18, prohibits discrimination because of pregnancy or maternity, requiring employers to ensure that redundancy selection criteria do not disadvantage employees on maternity leave to avoid unlawful discrimination claims. Regarding health and safety, the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, Regulation 16, mandates employers to perform a specific risk assessment for new or expectant mothers, and if risks are identified and cannot be avoided, the employer must adjust her working conditions or hours, offer suitable alternative work on no less favorable terms, or if no alternative is available, suspend her on full pay. Relevant case law, such as Sefton Borough Council v Wainwright [2014] EWCA Civ 953, confirms the obligation to offer suitable alternative employment to employees on maternity leave before others. Therefore, the employer must conduct a fair and non-discriminatory redundancy process, prioritize the employee for any suitable alternative positions, and address health and safety concerns by performing risk assessments and taking necessary actions to protect the employee.","

**Protections for an Employee on Maternity Leave During Redundancy and Health Concerns**

**1. Employment Rights Act 1996 (ERA 1996)**
   - **Redundancy Protections**: Employees on maternity leave are protected from being selected for redundancy due to pregnancy-related reasons. This protection extends during the period of leave, ensuring that employers cannot discriminately target pregnant employees for redundancy.
   
**2. Maternity and Parental Leave Regulations 1999 (MLR 1999)**
   - **Fair Treatment**: Employers must treat employees on maternity leave fairly, avoiding any discriminatory practices in redundancy procedures. The regulations ensure that such leave is protected from being used as a basis for unfavorable employment actions.

**3. Equality Act 2010 (EA 2010)**
   - **Discrimination Protection**: Employees are protected from discrimination based on sex or maternity status. This means employers cannot discriminate against pregnant employees, including those on maternity leave, when implementing redundancy measures.
   
**4. Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 (HSWR 1999)**
   - **Health and Safety Requirements**: Employers have a duty to ensure the health and safety of all employees. If returning to work poses serious health risks due to unsafe conditions, the employer must take steps to mitigate these risks, such as implementing reasonable adjustments or allowing remote work.
   
**5. Case Law and Precedent**
   - **Recent Cases**: There have been instances where employees on maternity leave successfully argued against redundancy based on ERA 1996 protections. Employers are required to follow fair procedures and not discriminately target pregnant employees.

**Employer Actions:**
   - **Fair Selection Process**: Ensure that redundancy procedures are conducted fairly, following legitimate criteria and avoiding discrimination.
   - **Health Risk Assessment**: Assess the working environment upon the employee's return to identify any health hazards and implement necessary precautions.
   - **Reasonable Adjustments**: Make adjustments if the employee’s health and safety is at risk, such as flexible work arrangements or remote work options.

**Employee Rights:**
   - **Redundancy Protection**: The employee can assert her right not to be selected for redundancy due to her pregnancy status while on leave.
   - **Health and Safety**: She has the right to a safe working environment and may seek adjustments if necessary.
   - **Discrimination Claims**: She can raise claims if she faces discrimination or health hazards at work.

**Conclusion:**
The employee is protected by various laws from Discrimination, unfair redundancy actions, and unsafe working conditions. The employer must adhere to these regulations and ensure her return to work is safe and non-discriminatory.","['', ' Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999, Regulation 10\r\n', ' Equality Act 2010, Section 18\r\n', ' Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, Regulation 16']",23,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999/3312), the Paternity and Adoption Leave Regulations 2002 (S.I. 2002/2788) and the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/3050). They also amend the Paternity and Adoption Leave (Adoption from Overseas) Regulations 2003 (S.I. 2003/921) and the Shared Parental Leave and Paternity and Adoption Leave (Adoptions from Overseas) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/3092) to ensure equivalent provision for those adopting children from overseas.
The amendments extend existing requirements that apply to employers when redundancy situations arise where an employee is on maternity, adoption or shared parental leave, so that those requirements can also apply during pregnancy and for a period of time after that leave has ended. For those taking shared parental leave who have not taken maternity or adoption leave, there is a six-week threshold of continuous leave that needs to be met for the requirements to apply for a period of time after shared parental leave has ended. Where the six-week threshold is not met, the requirements apply during shared parental leave.

Unitedkingdom,"A tenant in England reports a malfunctioning carbon monoxide alarm installed under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (Amendment) Regulations 2022. Despite notifying the landlord, the alarm has not been repaired or replaced after three weeks. The tenant is concerned about safety and compliance. Under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm Regulations 2015 (as amended), what are the landlord's legal obligations, and what actions can the tenant take?","Under Regulation 6 of the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015, when a landlord is served with a remedial notice for breaching one or more duties outlined in Regulation 4(1) (such as failing to install or maintain smoke or carbon monoxide alarms), the landlord must take the specified remedial actions within the timeframe set out in Regulation 5(2)(d), typically 28 days from the notice's issuance. This regulation imposes a clear duty on the landlord to address the breach promptly and ensures tenant safety through enforcement mechanisms. However, Regulation 6(2) provides that a landlord will not be considered in breach of this obligation if they can demonstrate that they have taken all reasonable steps, short of initiating legal proceedings, to comply with the duty. Reasonable steps may include hiring contractors, arranging access to the property, or documenting efforts to resolve tenant-related barriers to compliance. Proper evidence of these steps is crucial to establish the landlord’s diligence. This provision ensures that while landlords are held accountable, genuine efforts to comply are recognized, even if the issue remains unresolved due to circumstances beyond their control.","

**Answer:**

Under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm Regulations 2015 (as amended), landlords have specific legal obligations to ensure the safety of their tenants by maintaining smoke and carbon monoxide alarms. Here's a structured overview of the responsibilities and actions available:

### Landlord's Legal Obligations:
1. **Installation and Maintenance:**
   - Landlords must install smoke and carbon monoxide alarms as required by law.
   - Alarms must be kept in good working condition through regular maintenance and testing.

2. **Response to Tenant Reports:**
   - Tenants are legally obliged to report issues with alarms, and landlords must respond promptly.
   - Under the 2015 Regulations, there was an initial timeframe for response, typically within a certain number of days (e.g., 14 days).
   - The 2022 amendment may have extended this period or introduced penalties for non-compliance.

3. **Legal Consequences:**
   - Non-compliance can result in enforcement action by local authorities, including fines.
   - Landlords may face legal repercussions if they fail to address issues promptly.

### Tenant's Actions:
1. **Documentation:**
   - Document all communications with the landlord, possibly through a formal letter or email detailing the issue and required actions.

2. **Reporting Authorities:**
   - The tenant can approach local councils or housing authorities for assistance if the landlord does not respond.
   - Consider reporting the landlord to the relevant authority, especially if compliance is not met.

3. **Seeking Legal Advice:**
   - Consult legal advice if the landlord does not address the issue within the required timeframe.
   - Explore options such as pursuing a breach of contract claim or taking further action for tenant safety.

4. **Temporary Safety Measures:**
   - If the malfunctioning alarm poses an immediate risk, take precautions like ensuring proper ventilation and avoiding areas with potential carbon monoxide exposure until the issue is resolved.

### Key Considerations:
- The 2022 amendment may have extended response times or introduced new enforcement measures.
- Penalties for landlords failing to comply could include fines.
- Tenants should be aware of their rights and the importance of tenant safety in all circumstances.

By understanding these responsibilities and actions, tenants can better advocate for their safety and hold landlords accountable.","['', ' Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015 – Regulation 6: Duty of Relevant Landlord to Comply with a Remedial Notice\r\n', ' Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015 – Regulation 4: Duties of Landlords\r\n', ' Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015 – Regulation 5: Remedial Notices']",23,True,"Prohibitions on giving notice seeking possession relating to health and safety

Unitedkingdom,"An apprentice in England has turned 19 and has completed the first year of their apprenticeship.

Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 (as amended) and the National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015, what are the apprentice's rights regarding wages, and what steps can they take if their employer is not compliant?","

**Apprentice Wage Rights and Compliance Steps in England**

**1. Entitlement to National Minimum Wage (NMW):**
- Once an apprentice turns 19 or completes their first year of apprenticeship, they are entitled to receive at least the standard NMW rate. This applies regardless of whether they continue their apprenticeship or not.

**2. Understanding Wage Rates:**
- As of current data, the NMW for individuals aged 19 and over is £9.50 per hour (as of April 2023). However, recent amendments may have updated this rate, so it's essential to verify the latest figures from the government resources.

**3. Rights and Obligations:**
- Employers must ensure that wages meet the NMW requirements for each employee based on their age and apprenticeship status.
- After turning 19 or completing their first year, apprentices should no longer be paid the apprenticeship wage but rather the standard NMW.

**4. Steps for the Apprentice:**
- **Request Documentation:** The apprentice can ask their employer for proof of their age and the duration of their apprenticeship. This helps confirm if they are entitled to the NMW.
  
- **Escalation of Issues:** If the employer refuses to provide this documentation or fails to pay the correct wage, the apprentice can report the matter to:
  - **HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs):** To raise concerns about non-compliance with wage laws.
  - **Local Authority:** Under the Health and Safety Act 1974, local authorities can investigate workplace issues affecting wages.
  
- **Seek Advice:** Consulting organizations like ACAS (Advisory Conciliation Service) can provide guidance on understanding their rights and resolving disputes.

**5. Employer Penalties:**
- Employers found to be underpaying their staff face penalties, including fines, and may be subject to naming and shaming by HMRC.

**Conclusion:**
Apprentices aged 19 or who have completed one year of their apprenticeship are entitled to the standard NMW. They have rights to fair pay and can take steps to ensure their employer complies with wage regulations, which also protects them from penalties if employers neglect these laws.","['', ' National Minimum Wage Act 1998:\r\n', ' Employment Rights Act 1996, Section 13:\r\n', ' National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015, Regulation 5(1)']",23,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Unitedkingdom,"Residents in an English town are concerned that their local authority has not implemented separate food waste collections, as required by the Environment Act 2021. The deadline has passed, and there is no plan in place. What legal obligations does the local authority have under the Act, and what legal remedies are available to the residents to enforce compliance?","Under the Environment Act 2021, specifically Section 57, which inserts Section 45AZB into the Environmental Protection Act 1990, local authorities in England are legally obligated to arrange for the separate collection of food waste from households; failure to do so constitutes a breach of statutory duty. Residents can raise the issue with the local authority by submitting formal complaints requesting compliance, engage with local councillors and Members of Parliament (MPs) to advocate for action, and may have standing to apply for a judicial review of the local authority's failure to comply with statutory duties, as established in cases like R (on the application of Greenpeace Ltd) v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1998] Env LR 415; they must act promptly and within three months of the grounds arising.","

**Legal Obligations and Remedies Under the Environment Act 2021**

**1. Legal Obligations of Local Authorities:**
   - **Separate Food Waste Collections:** The Environment Act 2021 imposes a specific obligation on local authorities in England to implement separate food waste collections as part of their waste management strategies. This is typically outlined in the act's provisions regarding municipal waste and recycling.
   - **Meeting Targets:** Local authorities are often required to meet targets for collecting food waste, which may include separate collection schemes to reduce landfill dependency and promote environmental sustainability.

**2. Key Provisions of the Environment Act 2021:**
   - The act assigns responsibilities to local authorities to manage waste effectively, including provisions for separate food waste collection.
   - It may require publication of strategies or plans that outline how these collections will be implemented, with specific deadlines for compliance.

**3. Legal Remedies for Residents:**
   - **Report and Complain:** Residents can report the lack of implementation through official channels, such as local council complaint processes or environmental protection agencies.
   - **Request Information:** Under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA), residents have a right to access information about how their local authority is handling food waste. This can be used to hold the authority accountable and demand action.
   - **Appeals and Reviews:** If there's a failure to meet required standards, residents can request reviews or appeals through the relevant regulatory bodies, such as the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) for information breaches or the Environment Agency if there are compliance issues.

**4. Practical Actions Residents Can Take:**
   - **Engage in Dialogue:** Contact local council officials and express concerns about the lack of food waste collection plans.
   - **Lobby and Advocate:** Organize meetings, write letters, or even create a petition to pressure the authority into implementing required measures.
   - **Seek External Support:** Involve environmental organizations or MPs for assistance in addressing the issue formally.

**5. Penalties and Consequences:**
   - Local authorities may face financial penalties if they fail to meet targets set by the Environment Act 2021, including those related to food waste collection.
   - There could be legal consequences for non-compliance, such as breaches of statute leading to court actions or fines.

**6. Additional Regulations:**
   - The Waste Management Regulations might provide further guidance or detailed obligations for local authorities regarding food waste, including specific strategies and reporting requirements.

**Conclusion:**

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are the ninth commencement regulations made by the Secretary of State under the Environment Act 2021 (c.30) (“the Act”).
Regulation 2 brings into force on 17th May 2024 specified sections of the Act.
Section 57 of the Act amends the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (c. 43) (“the 1990 Act”) and the Environment Act 1995 (c. 25) (“the 1995 Act”). Subsection (4) substitutes new sections 45A to 45AZG for section 45A of the 1990 Act to introduce new requirements in England for the separate collection of household waste from domestic and relevant non-domestic premises, and of relevant waste. Subsections (5) and (6) amend sections 46(2) (receptacles for household waste) and 47(3) (receptacles for commercial or industrial waste) of the 1990 Act to enable English waste collection authorities to require the use of appropriate receptacles for the purposes of complying with the new duties under sections 45A to 45AZB of the 1990 Act. Subsection (8) amends the 1995 Act to enable the Environment Agency to make a charging scheme in relation to performing its functions relating to sections 45A to 45AZB of the 1990 Act.
Sections 74 to 77 of the Act provide for the Secretary of State to make regulations providing for the recall of relevant products, including motor vehicles, that do not meet relevant environmental standards.
Section 81 is commenced for the limited purpose of enabling regulations to be made under section 141DA into the Water Industry Act 1991 (c.56) (“the 1991 Act”).
Section 82(2), which is already partially commenced, makes consequential amendments to section 213 of the 1991 Act to include a reference to the regulation making powers of new sections 141DA and 141DB.
Regulation 3 brings into force section 79 of the Act on 1st September 2024 so far as relating to undertakers whose areas are wholly or mainly in England. Section 79 inserts new sections 94A to 94E into the 1991 Act, to introduce new requirements on sewerage undertakers to prepare, publish and maintain drainage and sewerage management plans.
Regulation 4 brings into force section 81 of the Act on 1st January 2025, for all remaining purposes. Section 81 inserts new section 141DA into the 1991 Act to establish a legal requirement for sewerage undertakers wholly or mainly in England to report in near real time on when a discharge starts and stops.
Regulation 5 makes transitional provision in connection with the commencement of section 57 of the Act in order to provide, in certain cases, an extended period for duty holders to comply with the new duties. In the meantime, English waste collection authorities must continue to comply with the requirements in section 45A(2) of the 1990 Act as it applied immediately before the coming into force of section 57 of the Act.
Regulations 6 and 7 make further transitional provisions in relation to the areas serviced by the English waste collection authorities that are specified in the first column of the Table in the Schedule. The duty holders in those areas have until the date specified for each authority in the corresponding entry in the second column of the Table in the Schedule to introduce separate food waste collections for domestic and relevant non-domestic premises. This is in order to account for existing long-term waste disposal contracts.
Regulation 6 also provides that the English waste collection authorities specified in the first column of the Table in the Schedule are not required to fully meet the condition in section 45A(3) of the 1990 Act until the date specified in the corresponding entry in the second column of the Table in the Schedule. The condition is that recyclable household waste must be collected separately from other household waste, in relation to the collection of garden waste, but only if the other household waste being collected with that garden waste is food waste.

Wales,"An employee lives in Wales but works in England. They are planning to take Shared Parental Leave (SPL) following the birth of their child. They are unsure how the differences between Welsh and English regulations might affect their entitlement and whether their residence in Wales impacts their rights. Under the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, what are their rights, and does their place of residence affect their entitlement? ","Under the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, which are authorized by the Employment Rights Act 1996, an employee's entitlement to Shared Parental Leave (SPL) is determined by their employment status and specific eligibility criteria, irrespective of their place of residence. The regulations apply uniformly across England and Wales. To qualify for SPL, the employee must have been continuously employed by the same employer for at least 26 weeks by the end of the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth and remain employed at the start of each period of SPL taken. Additionally, their partner must have worked (employed or self-employed) for at least 26 of the 66 weeks before the expected week of childbirth and have earned an average of at least £30 per week in 13 of those weeks. These criteria are outlined in the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, specifically in Part 2, Chapter 1, Regulation 6. Therefore, an employee residing in Wales and working in England is entitled to SPL, provided they meet these eligibility requirements, with their place of residence having no impact on their entitlement.","

Under the **Shared Parental Leave (SPL) Regulations 2014**, your rights as an employee living in Wales but working in England are primarily determined by your employment contract and your status as a worker in England. Here’s how your residence in Wales might impact your entitlement:

### Key Points:
1. **Eligibility for SPL**:  
   Your eligibility for Shared Parental Leave is based on your employment relationship, not your place of residence. Since you are employed in England, you should be entitled to request SPL if you meet the criteria outlined in the regulations (e.g., having worked for your employer for at least 26 weeks prior to the birth or adoption of your child).

2. **Impact of Welsh Residence**:  
   - **Entitlement**: Your place of residence does not directly affect your entitlement to SPL under the Regulations. The right to request SPL arises from your employment relationship, which is based in England.
   - **Calculation of Benefits**: However, if you are receiving benefits tied to your Welsh residence (e.g., Housing Benefit or Council Tax), this may not impact your SPL eligibility.

3. **Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)**:  
   If you qualify for SMP, it is a separate entitlement and does not affect your ability to request SPL. You can choose to take either SMP or SPL, or a combination of both, depending on your preference and circumstances.

4. **Employer Policies**:  
   It’s essential to check with your employer in England regarding their specific policies for employees who live outside the country. Some employers may have additional requirements or considerations for cross-border workers.

5. **Communication**: Make sure to inform your employer of your intended leave and provide them with any necessary documentation, even if you are residing in Wales. Your employer is required to handle your SPL request regardless of your place of residence.

### Practical Considerations:
- If you’re unsure about how your Welsh residence affects your entitlement, you can contact the **HMRC Childcare and Health Service Helpline** for clarification.
- Be aware that some benefits may require you to be resident in Wales, but SPL is typically tied to your employment status rather than your place of residence.

### Conclusion:
Your eligibility for Shared Parental Leave under the 2014 Regulations is primarily based on your employment in England. While your Welsh residence does not directly impact your entitlement, it’s important to communicate with your employer and ensure they understand your circumstances. If you have further questions, you can seek advice from organizations such as **Citizens Advice** or the **HMRC helpline**.","['', ' Employment Rights Act 1996:\r\n', ' Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014']",23,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

These Regulations amend the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999/3312), the Paternity and Adoption Leave Regulations 2002 (S.I. 2002/2788) and the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/3050).

The amendments extend existing requirements that apply to employers when redundancy situations arise where an employee is on maternity, adoption or shared parental leave, so that those requirements can also apply during pregnancy and for a period of time after that leave has ended. For those taking shared parental leave who have not taken maternity or adoption leave, there is a six-week threshold of continuous leave that needs to be met for the requirements to apply for a period of time after shared parental leave has ended. Where the six-week threshold is not met, the requirements apply during shared parental leave.

These Regulations relate to the treatment under Part 12ZD of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 of persons abroad, persons who work as mariners and persons who work on the continental shelf. The effect is that certain persons who would otherwise not fulfil the qualifying conditions for entitlement to statutory parental bereavement pay because of the nature of their employment or the fact that they are outside the United Kingdom will have an entitlement to such pay.
Regulation 4 limits the application of the Regulations to cases where the person would be treated as an employee under Part 12ZD of the Act if the employment were in Great Britain.
Regulation 5 provides for a person employed in a State of the European Economic Area but subject to the legislation of the United Kingdom to be treated as an employee for the purposes of Part 12ZD.
Regulation 6 provides for a person who is absent from Great Britain but in respect of whom an employer has secondary Class 1 national insurance contribution liability to be treated as an employee for the purposes of the Part 12ZD.
Where a person has worked for the same employer both in Great Britain and in a State of the European Economic Area, regulation 7 provides, in specified circumstances, for employment in the Member State to be treated as employed earner’s employment for the purposes of Part 12ZD.
Regulation 8 relaxes any time limit imposed by Part 12ZD of the Act or regulations made under it in relation to a person who cannot comply with the time limit because that person is outside the United Kingdom.

Wales,"A tenant in Wales is experiencing severe damp and mold in their rented property, which the landlord has failed to address despite repeated requests. Under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, what are the landlord's obligations regarding repairs and safety, and what actions can the tenant take to enforce these obligations?","Under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, landlords are obligated to maintain rental properties in a condition fit for human habitation. Specifically, Section 91 mandates that landlords must ensure the dwelling is fit for human habitation both at the start and throughout the duration of the tenancy. Section 92 requires landlords to keep in repair the structure and exterior of the dwelling, including drains, gutters, and external pipes, and to maintain installations for the supply of water, gas, electricity, sanitation, space heating, and heating water. If a landlord fails to address severe damp and mold despite repeated requests, the tenant should notify the landlord in writing, keeping records of all communications. If the landlord remains unresponsive, the tenant can contact the local authority's Environmental Health department, which can inspect the property and issue improvement notices. Additionally, the tenant may apply to the court for an order requiring the landlord to carry out repairs. It's advisable to seek legal advice before considering actions like withholding rent or arranging for repairs independently, as these carry legal risks.","

Under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, landlords have a clear obligation to maintain their rented properties in a habitable and safe condition. If a landlord fails to address severe damp and mold issues despite tenant requests, tenants have several avenues to enforce their rights:

1. **Report the Issue**: The tenant should continue to inform the landlord directly about the problems. This might prompt the landlord to take action, though repeated failures may necessitate further steps.

2. **Contact Housing Authorities**: Tenants can report the issue to local housing authorities or Welsh Housing Services, which may intervene to pressure the landlord into addressing the problem.

3. **Seek Legal Advice**: A tenant can consult a solicitor specializing in landlord-tenant law to explore their options. Legal action might be warranted if the landlord's inaction endangers health and safety.

4. **Injunctive Relief**: Tenants may seek an injunction from the court to compel the landlord to make necessary repairs, ensuring the property remains habitable.

5. **Consider Tenant Associations**: Joining a tenant association or contacting organizations like Shelter Cymru can provide guidance and support in resolving the issue collectively with other tenants.

6. **Defend Against Unfair Eviction**: Tenants have protections against retaliatory eviction if they report housing issues legally. landlords must follow proper procedures, and tenants can challenge any unjust evictions.

7. **Involve Third Parties**: External mediators or ombudsmen may assist in resolving the issue without court intervention, though this depends on the specific circumstances and available resources.

In summary, tenants facing neglectful landlords can take proactive steps to enforce their rights, starting with informal resolutions and escalating to legal action if necessary. Consulting professionals can help navigate the process effectively.","['', "" Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, Section 91: Landlord's obligation: fitness for human habitation\r\n"", "" Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, Section 92: Landlord's obligation to keep dwelling in repair""]",23,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Section 91 of the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016 (anaw 1) (“the Act”) requires a landlord, under a secure contract, a periodic standard contract or a fixed term standard contract made for a term of less than 7 years, to ensure that the dwelling is fit for human habitation, and section 92 requires the landlord to keep the dwelling in repair.
Section 94(1) requires the Welsh Ministers to prescribe matters and circumstances to which regard must be had when determining whether a dwelling is fit for human habitation, and section 94(2) enables the Welsh Ministers to prescribe matters and circumstances which may arise because of a landlord’s failure to keep the dwelling in repair. Section 94(3) enables the Welsh Ministers to impose requirements on landlords for the purpose of preventing those matters or circumstances from arising and to prescribe that if those requirements are not complied with, the dwelling is to be treated as if it were unfit for human habitation.
Regulation 3 and the Schedule prescribe the matters and circumstances to which regard must be had when determining whether a dwelling is fit for human habitation. This includes certain matters and circumstances which may arise because of a landlord’s failure to keep the dwelling in repair.
Regulation 4 provides that regulations 5 to 8 apply in relation to a secure contract, a periodic standard contract or a fixed term standard contract made for a term of less than 7 years, and which incorporate section 91 of the Act as a term of the contract. Regulation 4 applies regulations 5 to 8 to the same kinds of occupation contract as regulation 3.
Regulations 5 and 6 impose requirements on a landlord for the purpose of preventing any matters or circumstances which may cause a dwelling to be unfit for human habitation from arising.
Regulation 5 requires that smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms, in repair and proper working order, are present in a dwelling.
Regulation 6 requires that the electrical service installations in a dwelling are subject to inspection and testing (“an electrical safety inspection”) by a qualified person at intervals of 5 years or less; and that a copy of the condition report setting out the results of the electrical safety inspection is given to the contract-holder. If works are carried out on a dwelling’s electrical service installations between electrical safety inspections, the landlord must ensure that the contract-holder is given written confirmation that the works have been carried out.
Where a landlord fails to comply with a requirement imposed by regulation 5 or 6, the dwelling is to be treated as if it were unfit for human habitation; and the dwelling will continue to be treated as if it were unfit for human habitation under those regulations until the failure has been rectified by the landlord (see Part 4 of the Act for further provision about circumstances in which the obligations and liabilities of a landlord under that Part arise). If the failure re-occurs after rectification, the dwelling will again be treated as unfit for human habitation until it is rectified.
The landlord is in any event subject to the obligations in section 92 of the Act (if incorporated into the occupation contract) to keep electrical service installations in repair and proper working order. Those obligations will be relevant where an electrical safety inspection reveals that there are issues with an installation.
Regulation 7 makes provision about how these regulations operate in relation to existing tenancies and licences that become occupation contracts when the Act comes into force. Landlords under those contracts will have additional time within which to ensure compliance.
Regulation 8 makes provision relating to regulation 6, allowing landlords to rely on electrical condition reports obtained before these Regulations come into force.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

Wales,"A retailer in Wales is found selling alcohol below the minimum unit price set by the Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018. They argue that discounts and promotions allow them to reduce prices. What does the Act stipulate regarding minimum alcohol pricing, and what penalties could the retailer face for non-compliance?","Under the Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018, it is an offence for alcohol retailers in Wales to sell alcohol below the applicable minimum price, regardless of discounts or promotions. The Act defines the minimum price using the formula M × S × V, where M is the minimum unit price (set at 50p), S is the percentage strength of the alcohol, and V is the volume in litres. Non-compliance can result in enforcement actions by local authorities, including the issuance of fixed penalty notices of £200 for each offence. Therefore, retailers must adhere to the minimum pricing regulations, as discounts and promotions do not permit selling alcohol below the established minimum price.","

The Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018 establishes a minimum unit price to reduce alcohol-related harm by making alcohol less affordable. Retailers in Wales selling alcohol below this set price face penalties, including fines or having their business licenses revoked. The Welsh Revenue Authority and local councils enforce these regulations, potentially leading to stock confiscation. The severity of penalties may vary based on the extent and frequency of non-compliance.","['', ' Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018']",23,True,"WELSH STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS

Wales,"A homeowner in Wales wants to build a large extension to their property without applying for planning permission, arguing that it's within permitted development rights. Under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Wales) Order 1995 and recent amendments, what are the rules regarding extensions, and when is planning permission required?","Under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Wales) Order 1995, as amended, specific conditions allow certain extensions to be built without a formal planning application, known as permitted development rights. Below are the key provisions relevant to the homeowner’s question:\nRelevant Provisions for Extensions:\nVolume Limitations:\n                        * Terraced Houses or Properties on Article 1(5) Land: The cumulative volume of the extension must not exceed the volume of the original dwellinghouse by more than 50 cubic meters or 10% (whichever is greater).\n                        * Other Houses: The cumulative volume must not exceed 70 cubic meters or 15% (whichever is greater).\n                        * Absolute Limit: In all cases, the increase must not exceed 115 cubic meters.\nHeight Restrictions:\n                        * The height of the extension must not exceed the highest part of the existing roof.\n                        * For properties with a flat roof, the extension must not be taller than the height of the original dwellinghouse.\nProximity to Boundaries:\n                        * No part of the extension should be nearer to any highway than the nearest part of the original dwellinghouse unless the extension is at least 20 meters from the highway.\nDesignated Areas:\n                        * Properties in designated areas such as conservation areas, National Parks, or Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty have more restricted permitted development rights, potentially requiring formal planning permission even for smaller extensions.\nImportant Considerations:\n                        * Amendments: The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (Wales) Orders 2014 and 2019 introduce specific changes and clarifications but do not fundamentally alter the provisions related to standard extensions under Schedule 2, Part 1. The 2014 amendment refines some criteria for residential projects, while the 2019 amendment includes updates relevant to designated areas and certain types of land use.\n                        * Verification with Authorities: Due to potential nuances or recent legislative changes that could affect individual cases, consulting the local planning authority or a professional planner is crucial to confirm compliance with current regulations.","

Under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Wales) Order 1995, certain types of extensions fall under permitted development rights and do not require planning permission. However, the situation for a large extension depends on several key factors:

1. **Size and Type of Extension**: 
   - If the extension is a single-story rear or side extension, it may be permitted without planning permission if it meets the specified dimensions (typically up to 3 meters for rear extensions).
   
2. **Location**:
   - The extension should be attached to the main house or a structure considered part of the curtilage (land surrounding the property).

3. **Materials and Context**:
   - The materials used and how the extension affects the character of the area may influence whether planning permission is required.

4. **Recent Amendments**:
   - Any recent changes to the GPDO in Wales could affect what's considered permitted. For example, increased allowed dimensions or new exemptions might apply.

5. **Local Planning Policies**:
   - Additional rules from local planning authorities might necessitate planning permission, even if it falls under PD rights nationally.

6. **Environmental Impact**:
   - Specific cases like the Boston Alternative Energy Facility Order 2023 required planning permission despite being within PD rights due to environmental concerns.

In conclusion, while some large extensions may fall under permitted development, others may still require planning permission based on size, location, local policies, and environmental impact. It's advisable to consult with a local planning authority to determine whether planning permission is necessary for the specific extension.","['', ' The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, Schedule 2, Part 1\r\n', ' The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (Wales) Order 2014\r\n', ' The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (Wales) Order 2019']",23,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Wales,"A parent in Wales is seeking additional learning support for their child, who has been diagnosed with special educational needs (SEN). How does the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 protect the child’s right to education, and what steps should the parent take to ensure their child receives the necessary support?","The Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 provides a strong legal framework to protect the rights of children with special educational needs (SEN) in Wales, ensuring they receive appropriate education and support. Here's how the Act safeguards these rights and the steps parents should take:\nHow the Act Protects the Child’s Right to Education\n                           * Definition of Additional Learning Needs (ALN) (Section 2): The Act defines ALN as a learning difficulty or disability that requires additional learning provision. This ensures children who face significantly greater learning challenges than their peers or have disabilities affecting their use of educational facilities are identified and supported.\n                           * Individual Development Plans (IDPs) (Section 10): The Act mandates the creation of IDPs for children with ALN. These comprehensive, tailored plans detail the specific support required and are maintained by local authorities or educational institutions, guaranteeing that each child's unique needs are met.\n                           * Duties of Local Authorities and Schools (Sections 11 and 14): Local authorities and the governing bodies of maintained schools have a duty to identify children with ALN and make appropriate provisions. They must review these provisions regularly to ensure their effectiveness and adapt them as needed.\n                           * Participation and Rights (Section 6): The Act emphasizes involving children and their parents in the decision-making process regarding ALN support. Authorities must also consider the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, reinforcing a rights-based approach.\n                           * Access to Information and Advice (Section 9): The Act requires local authorities to provide parents with information and advice on ALN and the available support, empowering them to make informed decisions.\n                           * Dispute Resolution and Appeals (Sections 68 and 70): The Act establishes clear mechanisms for resolving disagreements. If parents are unsatisfied with the IDP or support provided, they can use local dispute resolution services. Additionally, they have the right to appeal decisions to the Education Tribunal for Wales.\nSteps Parents Should Take to Ensure Their Child Receives Support\n                           * Request an Assessment: Parents can request that the local authority assess their child for ALN. Although the Act does not explicitly state this in Section 11, it mandates that authorities and schools must decide if a child has ALN when concerns are raised.\n                           * Engage in the IDP Process: Actively participate in the development and review of the IDP. Ensure the IDP reflects the child's current needs and advocate for revisions as needed.\n                           * Utilize Available Resources: Make use of the information and advice provided by local authorities as mandated in Section 9. This will help parents understand their rights and the provisions their child is entitled to.\n                           * Address Disagreements: If there are concerns about the IDP or the support provided, use the dispute resolution mechanisms outlined in Section 68. For unresolved issues, parents can appeal to the Education Tribunal for Wales as outlined in Section 70.\n                           * Regularly Review the IDP: Ensure that the IDP is reviewed regularly, as mandated by the Act, to keep it aligned with the child’s evolving educational needs.\nThis framework ensures that children with SEN in Wales receive the educational support they require, and parents are empowered to advocate effectively for their child’s rights.","

The Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 provides a comprehensive framework to protect children with special educational needs (SEN) in Wales. Here's how it works:

1. **Legal Framework Replacement**: The Act replaces previous SEN legislation, establishing a structured approach to supporting children with additional learning needs. It ensures that schools and local authorities have clear duties towards these children.

2. **Early Identification and Support**: Parents should act early by identifying their child's SEN through observation and seeking professional advice. This step is crucial for timely intervention and support.

3. **Duties of Local Authorities**: The local authority has a legal responsibility to assess and respond to the child's needs, ensuring access to appropriate support services. This includes providing an Individual Development Plan (IDP) tailored to the child's requirements.

4. **Individual Development Plan (IDP)**: An IDP is a key document that outlines the child's educational targets and necessary support. If the child lacks capacity to understand the content, certain duties may not apply, ensuring the plan is adapted appropriately.

5. **Parental Role**: Parents play an active role in advocating for their child. They should engage with the local authority and seek guidance from organizations like the Welsh Assembly Government.

6. **Exceptions and Safeguards**: The Act includes provisions that consider the child's capacity to understand, providing flexibility while ensuring legal requirements are met. This can affect how support is delivered but must still adhere to the framework.

7. **Seeking Advice**: Parents should seek advice if they encounter barriers or issues in accessing support. Legal challenges or appeals may be necessary if there's a failure to meet the child's needs.

In summary, the 2018 Act offers a structured approach to SEN support in Wales. Parents are encouraged to act early, work with local authorities, and ensure their child receives appropriate support through an IDP. If needed, seeking external advice can help navigate the system effectively.","['', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 2: Definition of Additional Learning Needs (ALN)\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 6: Participation and Rights\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 9: Access to Information and Advice\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 10: Individual Development Plans (IDPs)\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 11: Duties to Decide: Maintained Schools and Further Education Institutions\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 14: Duties of Local Authorities and Schools\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 68: Dispute Resolution Mechanisms\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 70: Appeals to the Education Tribunal for Wales']",23,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Scotland,"An employee in Scotland has recently lost a child and is unsure of their entitlement to bereavement leave. Under the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018, what are their rights, and what obligations does the employer have?","Under the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018, incorporated into the Employment Rights Act 1996 and the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, employees in Scotland who have lost a child are entitled to specific rights, and employers have corresponding obligations. Section 80EA of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (as amended) grants eligible employees the right to take at least two weeks of parental bereavement leave. This leave must be taken within 56 days from the date of the child’s death and applies to the death of a child under 18. Section 80EE extends these rights to cases involving stillbirths after 24 weeks of pregnancy. Employers are obligated to provide this leave, ensuring that eligible employees can take time off without facing any detriment or dismissal related to their leave request. For statutory parental bereavement pay, Section 171ZZ6 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (as amended) outlines the entitlement, specifying that the employee must meet certain conditions such as a continuous employment period of at least 26 weeks ending with the ""relevant week"" (the week immediately before the child’s death) and minimum earnings meeting the lower earnings limit. Section 171ZZ7 adds that employees must give notice to their employer about the weeks for which they seek parental bereavement pay, and employers may require this notice in writing. Regulations under this section may also stipulate further requirements, such as providing evidence of entitlement or conditions for determining continuous employment. In addition to these primary sections, reviewing supporting regulations linked to the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018 and related guidance is essential for comprehensive compliance. Regulations detail how leave is to be taken, how statutory pay is processed, and additional procedural requirements for both employees and employers.","

**Employee Rights and Employer Obligations Under the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018 in Scotland**

**Employee Rights:**
1. **Statutory Bereavement Leave:** Employees are entitled to a specific number of days off work as set by the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018, which was inserted into the Employment Rights Act 1996 as Section 80EA. This entitlement may vary based on the employer's size, with smaller employers (fewer than 15 employees) offering different terms compared to larger ones.
   
2. **Contractual Rights:** If an employee has a contractual agreement that includes provisions for bereavement leave, these rights must be respected. Such contracts may offer more generous terms, including additional days off or higher pay.

3. **Combination of Rights:** Employees can choose to exercise either their statutory right or their contractual right, whichever is more favorable in each instance. This flexibility allows the employee to take the maximum allowed days with the best available benefits.

**Employer Obligations:**
1. **Notification and Information:** Employers must inform employees about both their statutory and contractual entitlements. This information should be provided clearly and within a reasonable timeframe after notification of the loss, ideally through written materials or discussions.

2. **Avoiding Unauthorised Deductions:** Employers are prohibited from deducting unauthorized pay related to bereavement leave. Any such deductions must be challenged by the employee, ensuring that lawful payments are not penalized retroactively.

3. **Preventing Discrimination:** Employers must not discriminate against employees taking bereavement leave. All such cases should be treated fairly and without discrimination based on gender or other protected characteristics.

4. **Reasonable Adjustments:** Upon return to work, employers are required to make reasonable adjustments to accommodate the employee's needs, such as flexible working hours, to support their well-being.

In summary, the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018 provides statutory protections for employees in Scotland dealing with child loss, while also respecting any contractual entitlements. Employers must adhere to these laws, ensuring fair treatment, clear communication, and reasonable adjustments upon return.","['', ' 1.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations introduce a new statutory entitlement for bereaved parents who are employees to take up to two weeks’ leave from their job called parental bereavement leave in the 56 weeks following the death of a child. These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers inserted into the Employment Rights Act 1996 (c. 18) (the “1996 Act”) by the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay Act) 2018 (c. 24).
Part 2 relates to entitlement to parental bereavement leave. The right to take parental bereavement leave is conferred by regulation 4 which sets out the conditions for entitlement which must be satisfied by the employee in order to take parental bereavement leave. These include substantive requirements, such as the employee falling within the definition of a bereaved parent (in particular, specifying the types of parental relationships in respect of which the new entitlement arises), as well as procedural requirements, such as the employee giving appropriate notices to their employer. Where an employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave under regulation 4 as the result of the death of more than one child, the employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave in respect of each child.
Regulation 5 sets out the number of weeks of parental bereavement leave that are available to a bereaved parent and gives an employee the option of taking either one or two weeks’ parental bereavement leave. The weeks taken as parental bereavement leave do not need to be taken consecutively. It also provides that parental bereavement leave may only be taken within the period of 56 weeks beginning with the date of the child’s death.
Regulation 6 details the notice requirements and other information the bereaved parent must provide to their employer before taking parental bereavement leave. An employee does not need to provide notice in writing to his or her employer, but the length of notice required to book and cancel parental bereavement leave will vary depending on whether the period the employee intends to take as parental bereavement leave falls within 56 days of the child’s death or later. Regulations 7 and 8 respectively set out when an employee’s period of bereavement leave may start and what happens when a period of parental bereavement leave is interrupted by another type of statutory leave under Part 8 of the 1996 Act.
Part 3 contains provisions applicable in relation to the taking of parental bereavement leave. Regulation 9 elaborates on the new section 80EB of the 1996 Act, by providing that an employee is entitled during his or her absence on leave to the benefit of all of his or her terms and conditions of employment apart from the right to remuneration (excluded by Section 80EB(3)(b)); also that the employee is subject to all of the obligations under those terms and conditions except in so far as they are inconsistent with the right to take parental bereavement leave (the exception appears in section 80EB(1)(b)). Regulations 10 and 11 provide for an employee’s right to return to work after taking a period of parental bereavement leave, distinguishing the case where the leave was an isolated period of absence from the case where it followed another period of statutory leave. Regulations 12 and 13 provide that an employee entitled to parental bereavement leave is protected from detriment and dismissal attributable to the fact that they took or sought to take parental bereavement leave.
Part 4 contains provisions applicable where an employee has a contractual right to parental bereavement leave, in addition to the statutory right contained within these Regulations.

Scotland,"A tenant in Scotland has reported significant dampness and mold in their rented flat to the landlord, who has not taken any action. Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, what are the landlord's obligations, and what steps can the tenant take to enforce these obligations?","Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, landlords are required to ensure that their rental properties meet the Repairing Standard, as defined in Section 13 of the Act. This includes ensuring that the property is wind and watertight, reasonably fit for human habitation, and that the structure and exterior are in a reasonable state of repair. Additionally, installations for the supply of water, gas, electricity, sanitation, heating, and hot water must be kept in proper working order. Significant dampness and mold indicate a failure to meet this standard. Under Section 14, landlords have a duty to ensure that the house meets the repairing standard at the start of the tenancy and throughout its duration. This duty requires landlords to complete any necessary repairs within a reasonable time after being notified by the tenant or otherwise becoming aware of the need for repairs. Failure to act within a reasonable timeframe constitutes a breach of this duty. If the landlord does not take action, the tenant can apply to the First-tier Tribunal under Section 22 of the Act. This section allows tenants to seek a decision from the Tribunal if the property does not meet the Repairing Standard. The Tribunal can investigate and issue a Repairing Standard Enforcement Order (RSEO) under Section 24, compelling the landlord to carry out the required repairs within a specified timeframe. If the landlord fails to comply with the RSEO, under Section 26, the Tribunal must notify the local authority and may consider imposing a rent relief order to reduce the tenant’s rent. The Tribunal may excuse non-compliance if the landlord demonstrates an inability to comply due to a lack of necessary rights (e.g., access) or if the required work poses a danger to any person. In such cases, the Tribunal must notify the local authority of its findings. The Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 provides tenants with clear mechanisms to address substandard housing conditions and enforce their rights against landlords who fail to fulfill their obligations. These regulations govern the procedures of the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland Housing and Property Chamber, which is responsible for handling cases brought under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, including applications related to the Repairing Standard. The regulations ensure that disputes between tenants and landlords are resolved fairly and efficiently. They outline the rules for submitting applications, conducting hearings, issuing decisions, and enforcing orders such as Repairing Standard Enforcement Orders (RSEOs). This procedural framework directly supports tenants in seeking remedies for landlords' failures to meet their legal obligations under the Act.","

**Landlord's Responsibilities Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006:**

1. **Duty to Maintain Fit for Habitation:** Landlords are legally required to ensure their properties are fit for habitation, free from health hazards such as dampness and mold.

2. **Obligation to Respond:** When notified by a tenant about such issues, landlords must conduct an inspection and take action to remedy the problem within a reasonable timeframe.

3. **Housing Services or Tenant Services:** Tenants can report these conditions to their local authority, such as the Housing Services or Tenant Services team, which will then engage the landlord to address the issue.

4. **Repairing Standards:** The repairs required must meet specific standards outlined in relevant legislation, ensuring that actions taken by the landlord are appropriate and timely.

**Tenant's Steps to Enforce Obligations:**

1. ** escalate to Local Authority:** If the landlord doesn't respond adequately, tenants can contact the local authority to intervene and enforce compliance with housing laws.

2. **Seek Legal Advice:** Affected tenants may consider legal action to seek compensation or remedy if their health is significantly impacted due to these conditions.

3. **Involve Environmental Health Services:** Tenants can involve professional services to assess the severity of the issue and document the need for action by the landlord.

4. **Report to Court:** In severe cases, tenants might file a court action to seek enforcement of housing standards and potentially secure compensation for their distress.

By understanding these responsibilities and steps, tenants can effectively address issues like dampness and mold in their rented properties.","['', ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 13: The Repairing Standard\r\n', "" Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 14: Landlord's Duty to Repair and Maintain\r\n"", ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 22: Application to the First', 'tier Tribunal\r\n', ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 24: Repairing Standard Enforcement Order (RSEO)\r\n', ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 26: Effect of Failure to Comply with Repairing Standard Enforcement Order\r\n', ' Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014\r\n', ' First', 'tier Tribunal for Scotland Housing and Property Chamber (Procedure) Regulations 2017 https://www.legislation.gov.Unitedkingdom/ssi/2017/328/contents/made']",23,True,"47

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations introduce measures to improve the energy efficiency of certain private rented property in Scotland.
The Regulations apply to domestic private rented property. They prescribe a minimum level of energy efficiency by means of the energy performance indicator included on the energy performance certificate for the property. This minimum level is set for the period from 1 October 2020 to 31 March 2022 as an energy efficiency or performance rating of E, and for the period from and after 1 April 2022 as an energy efficiency or performance rating of D. The Regulations provide that, subject to prescribed exceptions, a landlord of a domestic private rented property must not grant a new tenancy of the property after 1 October 2020, and must not continue to let the property after that date, where the energy efficiency or performance rating of the property is below the minimum level.
The Regulations make provision for the enforcement of the requirements of the Regulations by local authorities in relation to domestic private rented properties (“enforcement authority”). Landlords seeking to rely on a prescribed exemption when letting a private rented property which falls below the minimum level of energy efficiency must register that exemption on a register maintained by the local authority for their area.

Where an enforcement authority is satisfied that a landlord is in breach, it may issue a penalty notice imposing a financial penalty.

Scotland,"An individual in Scotland is experiencing domestic abuse from their partner with whom they share a tenancy. They wish to remove the abuser from the home but are unsure of their rights. Under the Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021, what legal protections are available, and what steps should they take?","Individuals experiencing domestic abuse in Scotland can seek protection through several legal mechanisms. Under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, they can apply for a Non-Harassment Order, which prohibits the abuser from engaging in threatening or harassing behavior. Additionally, the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981 allows for an Exclusion Order to remove the abuser from the shared home and prevent them from re-entering. This Act applies not only to married couples but also to cohabitants. The individual should contact the police to report the abuse, as domestic abuse is a criminal offense under the Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2018, which recognizes controlling behavior as abuse. Seeking legal advice from a solicitor experienced in domestic abuse cases is advisable to assist with applications for protective orders, and engaging with support services such as Scottish Women's Aid can provide additional assistance and guidance.","

Under the Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021, an individual in Scotland experiencing domestic abuse who shares a tenancy with their partner has several key legal protections and steps they can take:

### Legal Protections:
1. **Exclusion Orders (Section 6):**
   - The court may issue an exclusion order requiring the abuser to leave the family home and remain away for up to 12 months. This provides immediate temporary protection.

2. **Protection Orders (Section 7):**
   - A Protection Order can legally prohibit the abuser from contacting, following, or harassing the survivor. This is crucial when they live together, helping to prevent further abuse.

3. **Housing Support:**
   - Scottish Housing Chart erities may have duties to assist victims, potentially rehousing them if it's safe and necessary. This support can be critical for ensuring the tenant's safety.

4. **Eviction of the Abuser:**
   - The tenant can notify the landlord of the abuser's behavior, leading to eviction proceedings. If the abuser does not comply with legal orders, the landlord may take action to evict them.

### Steps to Take:
1. **Seek Immediate Safety:**
   - Contact the police if there is an immediate threat. They may assist by ordering the abuser to leave or provide a protection order.

2. **Apply for Legal Orders:**
   - The tenant can apply to the court for an exclusion order and/or Protection Order under sections 6 and 7 of the Act, respectively.

3. **Engage Housing Support:**
   - Contact Shelter Scotland or other housing charities for advice on their rights and available support, including potential rehousing.

4. **Collect Evidence:**
   - Gather evidence such as text messages, emails, photos, and witness statements to support any legal action.

5. **Consider Tenancy Options:**
   - Discuss the situation with the landlord, providing evidence of abuse affecting their ability to live safely. This may lead to the abuser being evicted.

6. **Seek Legal Advice:**
   - Contact a legal aid service or advice organization like Scottish Women's Aid for guidance tailored to their circumstances.

By understanding these protections and taking proactive steps, the individual can work towards a safer living environment.","['', ' Protection from Harassment Act 1997\r\n', ' Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981\r\n', ' Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2018']",23,True,"Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision in connection with the redress scheme established by the Redress for Survivors (Historical Child Abuse in Care) (Scotland) Act 2021 (asp 15) (“the Act”).
Section 18 of the Act enables a person to apply for a redress payment if the person or, in the case of an application for a next of kin payment, the person in respect of whom the application is made was abused while a child, and resident in a relevant care setting in Scotland. The abuse (as defined in section 19 of the Act to include sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse and abuse which takes the form of neglect) must have occurred before 1 December 2004. The definition of “relevant care setting” in section 20 of the Act comprises residential institutions such as children’s homes and residential care facilities, as well as other residential placements in consequence of boarding out or fostering arrangements. Section 18 is subject to section 23 of the Act.
Section 23(1) of the Act enables the Scottish Ministers to make regulations providing that an application may not be made under section 18 if the person who carried out the abuse was of a specified description, if the abuse was carried out in circumstances of a specified description, if the person who was abused came to be resident in the relevant care setting concerned in specified circumstances, or if the person who was abused was resident in the relevant care setting concerned for a specified purpose.
These Regulations make provision under section 23 of the Act for the purpose of creating exceptions to eligibility to apply for a redress payment under section 18 of the Act.
Regulation 2 makes provision for an exception where a person was placed in a relevant care setting for the purpose of being provided with short-term respite or holiday under arrangements made between a parent or guardian of that person and another person.

Scotland,"A retailer in Scotland is considering selling alcohol below the minimum unit price due to competitive pressures. They want to know the legal implications. Under the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012, what are the retailer's obligations, and what penalties could they face for non-compliance? ","Under the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012, which amends the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, retailers in Scotland are required to sell alcohol at or above a minimum unit price (MPU) set by the Scottish Ministers. This rule applies to all licensed premises, including shops, bars, restaurants, and temporary events with occasional licenses. The minimum price condition is detailed in Schedule 3, Paragraph 6A for premises licenses and Schedule 4, Paragraph 5A for occasional licenses. Alcohol must be sold at a minimum price calculated by multiplying the MPU by the strength and volume of the alcohol. As amended by The Alcohol (Minimum Price per Unit) (Scotland) Order 2018, the current MPU is set at 65 pence per unit. Retailers must comply with this minimum price, and selling alcohol below this threshold constitutes a breach of licensing conditions. If a retailer fails to meet the minimum pricing requirement, Section 36 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 allows the licensing board to review the premises license and impose penalties as needed. Following a review, the board may suspend the license temporarily, revoke the license entirely, or modify the license conditions to enforce compliance. These penalties aim to uphold public health and ensure responsible alcohol sales.","

Under the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012, retailers in Scotland have a legal obligation to sell alcohol at or above the minimum unit price. Here's a structured overview of your responsibilities and potential penalties for non-compliance:

### Legal Obligations:
1. **Minimum Unit Price Compliance**: The Act sets a floor price per unit of pure alcohol. Retailers must ensure that the price of their alcohol does not fall below this minimum price. This applies to both on-sale (e.g., in pubs) and off-sale (e.g., in shops) transactions.

2. **Record-Keeping**: Maintain accurate records of all alcohol sales, including prices, to provide documentation upon request during audits or inspections.

3. **Licensing Requirements**: Ensure you have the appropriate license for selling alcohol, which is typically issued by the relevant authority, such as local licensing boards.

### Enforcement and Penalties:
1. **Enforcement Agencies**: The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and local licensing boards are responsible for enforcing the Act.

2. **Monitoring and Compliance**: Retailers may face random checks or complaints from competitors, leading to potential enforcement action.

3. **Penalties for Non-Compliance**:
   - **Fines**: Monetary penalties can be imposed for selling below the minimum price.
   - **Licensing Revocation**: The authority may revoke your alcohol license, severely impacting your ability to conduct business.

### Considerations and Strategies:
1. **Competitive Strategy**: Focus on higher-margin products or promotions that do not involve selling below the minimum price. Innovate in other areas to remain competitive without violating the law.

2. **Legal Consultation**: Seek advice from legal professionals or industry associations to navigate the regulations effectively.

3. **Public Health Support**: Complying with the Act supports public health objectives, contributing to a safer community by reducing alcohol-related harm.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order is made under section 2(2) of the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012 (“the 2012 Act”). It comes into force on 30 April 2024.
Section 1 of the 2012 Act inserted provisions into schedules 3 and 4 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, introducing a further mandatory condition of premises licences and occasional licences. The condition is that alcohol must not be sold on the premises at a price below its minimum price. These provisions are the “minimum pricing provisions”.
Section 2(1) of the 2012 Act provides that the minimum pricing provisions expire 6 years after section 1 of the 2012 Act came fully into force unless an Order is made under section 2(2) of that Act to continue the effect of those provisions. Section 1 of the 2012 Act came fully into force on 1 May 2018. This Order continues the effect of the minimum pricing provisions.

This Order is made under section 146(2), paragraph 6A(4) of schedule 3 and paragraph 5A(4) of schedule 4 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 (“the 2005 Act”). It comes into force on 3 April 2020.
The Order amends the Alcohol (Minimum Price per Unit) (Scotland) Order 2018 (“the 2018 Order”) which specifies the minimum price per unit for alcohol (50 pence).
Article 2(3) of the Order inserts a new article 2A into the 2018 Order. The new article 2A provides that the minimum price per unit specified in article 2 of the 2018 Order does not apply to sales of alcohol to trade.
Article 2(2) of the Order inserts a definition of “sales to trade” into article 1 of the 2018 Order.

Scotland,"A parent in Scotland believes their child requires additional support in school due to a learning difficulty. Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 (as amended), what rights does the child have, and what steps can the parent take to secure the necessary support?","Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004, as amended, children in Scotland who require additional support due to learning difficulties are legally entitled to specific rights. Education authorities have a duty to assess and provide for these needs when required. According to Section 8(1), if a parent requests an assessment to determine whether their child has additional support needs or requires a Co-ordinated Support Plan (CSP), the education authority must comply with this request unless it is deemed unreasonable. Following assessment, Section 4(1)(a) requires the education authority to make adequate and efficient provision for the identified needs, which can include specialized resources or tailored teaching approaches. If a child’s support needs involve multiple agencies, such as social work or healthcare in addition to education, Section 9(1) ensures they are entitled to a CSP, a document outlining coordinated support across agencies. Parents also have the right, under Section 12(2), to be actively involved in developing and reviewing support plans to ensure that their child’s educational requirements are fully understood and addressed. If disagreements arise regarding the support provided or decisions made, Section 18(1) grants parents the right to appeal to the Additional Support Needs Tribunal for Scotland, which can make binding rulings on disputes related to additional support. These legislative provisions provide a strong framework for ensuring children’s educational needs are met and give parents a clear process to advocate for the support their child requires.","

**Answer:**

Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 (as amended), children in Scotland have specific rights when they require additional educational support due to learning difficulties. These rights include:

1. **Right to Additional Support:** The Act mandates that children who are identified as needing extra help must receive it. This could involve tailored teaching methods, additional resources, or specialized assistance.

2. **Procedural Steps for Parents:**
   - **Request Assessment:** A parent can initiate the process by formally requesting an assessment of their child's needs from the local authority.
   - **Local Authority Response:** The local authority is required to respond within a specified timeframe, typically 45 working days from receipt of the request.

3. **Support Plan Creation:**
   - Upon assessment, if support is deemed necessary, the local authority must collaborate with the parent and school to develop an Individual Education Plan (IEP) or equivalent document. This plan outlines specific strategies and resources to help the child.

4. **Appeals Mechanism:** Parents have the right to appeal decisions regarding the type or amount of support provided. Disagreements can be addressed through formal complaints, which may escalate to judicial reviews if necessary.

5. **Equality Provisions:** The Act ensures that children with learning difficulties are not unfairly treated and that their rights are protected throughout the process.

6. **Parental Involvement:** Parents play a crucial role in the process, from requesting assessments to participating in plan creation and monitoring progress.

7. **Support Types:** Support can include extra teaching hours, resource assistants, or specialized equipment, tailored to the child's specific needs.

8. **Local Authority Responsibilities:** Local authorities must consult with parents when creating support plans and have a duty to ensure timely responses and effective implementation of support.

In summary, the Act provides a structured framework for securing additional educational support, emphasizing the importance of collaboration between home, school, and local authorities to meet children's needs effectively.",['Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004'],23,True,"Prospective

NothernIreland,"An individual in NothernIreland is experiencing domestic abuse and seeks protection from their abuser. Under the Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (NothernIreland) 2021, what legal protections are available, and what steps should they take to secure those protections?","An individual in NothernIreland experiencing domestic abuse is protected under the Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (NothernIreland) 2021. Specifically, Section 1 of the Act criminalizes a course of abusive behaviour towards a person to whom the abuser is personally connected, such as a partner, ex-partner, or family member. The individual should report the abuse to the Police Service of NothernIreland to initiate a criminal investigation under this Act. Section 2 defines ""abusive behaviour"" as behaviour that is violent or threatening, or behaviour where a reasonable person would consider the course of behaviour likely to cause one or more of the following effects on the victim (B):
                                       * Making B dependent on, or subordinate to, A (the abuser);
                                       * Isolating B from friends, relatives, or other sources of social interaction or support;
                                       * Controlling, regulating, or monitoring B's day-to-day activities;
                                       * Depriving B of, or restricting, freedom of action;
                                       * Frightening, humiliating, degrading, or punishing B.
While the Act does not provide specific protective orders, the individual may apply for a Non-Molestation Order or an Occupation Order under the Family Homes and Domestic Violence (NothernIreland) Order 1998. A Non-Molestation Order can prohibit the abuser from molesting the applicant or a relevant child, and an Occupation Order can regulate the occupation of the shared residence. Additionally, Sections 25 to 28 of the Act offer special measures in civil proceedings to support victims, such as prohibiting the abuser from cross-examining the victim in person.
To secure these protections, the individual should:
                                       1. Report the abuse to the Police Service of NothernIreland to initiate criminal proceedings under the Act.
                                       2. Seek legal advice to apply for a Non-Molestation Order or an Occupation Order through the courts.
                                       3. Utilize the special measures provided in the Act during any civil proceedings to ensure their safety and well-being.","

In Northern Ireland, individuals experiencing domestic abuse can access several legal protections under the Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (2021). Here is a structured approach to securing these protections:

### Legal Protections Available:
1. **Protection Orders:**
   - **Application Process:** The individual can apply for a protection order through the police or directly in court if they feel safe. This order prevents the abuser from contacting, threatening, or harming them.
   - **Court Application:** Police can apply on behalf of the victim, ensuring the order is granted to safeguard their well-being.

2. **Financial Remedies:**
   - The court may issue orders requiring the abuser to share income or provide financial support for living expenses, rent, or other necessary costs.

3. **Housing Support:**
   - Local authorities can provide temporary housing if the individual is homeless due to abuse.
   - Legal aid may be available to assist with housing-related issues, ensuring access to safe accommodation.

4. **Compensation:**
   - The individual can pursue a civil claim for damages if their rights are violated under human rights laws, seeking compensation for harm caused by the abuser.

5. **Cross-Examination Protections:**
   - Automatic protections in family and civil proceedings prevent cross-examination by the abuser where evidence of domestic abuse exists, enhancing safety during court processes.

### Steps to Secure Protection:
1. **Report Abuse:** Contact the police to report the abuser, leading to potential criminal charges which strengthen civil cases.
2. **Apply for Protection Order:** Apply through the police or directly in court if safe, ensuring legal safeguards.
3. **Seek Legal Advice:** Consult with a lawyer to navigate the legal system and understand available remedies.
4. **Access Housing Support:** Contact local authorities for temporary housing and explore shelters or support groups for additional assistance.
5. **Consider Civil Claims:** Explore the possibility of suing for compensation if state protections were inadequate.

### Additional Resources:
- **Helplines:** Utilize domestic abuse helplines for immediate guidance and support.
- **The Protection from Stalking Act (2003):** Offers legal recourse against stalking, including that related to domestic abuse.

Taking these steps can empower individuals to protect themselves and seek the necessary support and remedies.","['', ' Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (NothernIreland) 2021\r\n', ' Family Homes and Domestic Violence (NothernIreland) Order 1998']",23,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Sections 65 and 66 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 (c. 17) introduce new Part 4A into the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 and new Part 7A into the Courts Act 2003, respectively. Those provisions operate in family and civil proceedings to prohibit cross-examination in person between a party and a witness in defined circumstances, including where there is evidence of domestic abuse between them. The prohibition will apply automatically where there has been a conviction, charge (applicable in family proceedings only) or caution for a specified offence, where an on-notice protective injunction is in force between the party and witness or where there is other specified evidence of domestic abuse.
These Regulations specify the types of offences, protective injunctions and forms of evidence which will trigger the automatic prohibition of cross-examination in person between the party and witness.

NothernIreland,"An employee in NothernIreland suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage. Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015, what are their rights, and what steps can they take to address the issue?","Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015, an employee in NothernIreland who suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage (NMW) has specific rights and actionable steps to address the issue. The Act mandates that employees must be paid at least the NMW, as set out in Section 1(1), which establishes the legal entitlement to minimum wage for all qualifying workers. Employers are legally required to keep accurate records of wage payments under Section 9 of the Act. These records should be sufficient to demonstrate that an employee is being paid at least the NMW. Therefore, the first step for the employee is to review their pay records to confirm any potential underpayment. Should there be a discrepancy, Section 10 grants the employee the right to formally request access to these records, enabling them to verify their calculations against the NMW requirement. If the employee identifies an underpayment, they should raise this issue with their employer, as it may be an oversight. If the employer fails to resolve the issue, the employee can escalate the matter to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the body responsible for enforcing compliance. While Section 13 of the Act authorizes the Secretary of State to appoint officers for enforcement purposes, Section 14 provides HMRC officers with the power to issue enforcement notices if employers are found non-compliant.  While the Act provides the primary framework, the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015 offer additional details for specific situations, such as valuing accommodation benefits or adjusting for absences, which can influence wage calculations. For most straightforward underpayment cases, the Act alone provides the necessary rights and procedures, with the Regulations supporting only in specific circumstances affecting wage calculation. In addition to these provisions, the Employment Rights (NothernIreland) Order 1996 is also relevant as it grants the employee a procedural framework for seeking redress if they are not compensated as per the NMW. Under the 1996 Order, if an employee experiences a sustained issue with underpayment, they have the right to file a claim with an Industrial Tribunal. This Order, though not specifically addressing minimum wage rates, is essential for the employee’s right to fair wages, as it permits claims for unlawful deduction of wages or breach of contract, allowing the employee to recover underpaid amounts. The 1996 Order thus complements the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 by establishing legal recourse in cases of wage disputes.","

If an employee in Northern Ireland suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage, they should follow these organized steps:

1. **Verify the Minimum Wage Rate**: Check the current National Minimum Wage rate for their role using official sources or labor rights organizations.

2. **Review PaySlip**: Compare the employee's payslip against the verified minimum wage to identify any discrepancies.

3. **Report the Issue**: Contact the Labour Relations Agency (LRA) to file a complaint, as they are the designated authority for such matters in Northern Ireland.

4. **Request Information from Employer**: The employee should formally request documentation from their employer confirming their earnings against the minimum wage standard.

5. **Document All Communications**: Keep records of all interactions with the employer, including letters, emails, or phone calls, to support any formal complaint.

6. **Escalate if Necessary**: If the issue isn't resolved, escalate it by contacting the LRA again, possibly seeking their intervention for enforcement actions.

7. **Consult Legal Advice**: Consider consulting a solicitor or Citizens Advice for guidance on potential legal action against the employer if they fail to comply.

8. **Be Aware of Exemptions**: Verify if the employee's role falls under any exemptions that might affect their minimum wage entitlement, which could avoid unnecessary steps if applicable.

9. **Act Within Time Limits**: File complaints promptly to adhere to any time constraints for protecting rights under labor laws.

By following these steps, the employee can address the suspected underpayment effectively and seek resolution through appropriate channels.","['', ' National Minimum Wage Act 1998\r\n', ' National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015\r\n', ' The Employment Rights (NothernIreland) Order 1996']",23,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

These Regulations amend the National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/621) (“the 2015 Regulations”) and come into force on 1st April 2024.
Regulation 57(1) of the 2015 Regulations provides that the term “work” within those Regulations does not include any work done in relation to an employer’s family household if the requirements set out in regulation 57(2) or (3) are met. These Regulations remove regulation 57(3) of the 2015 Regulations (“paragraph (3)”). The requirements set out in paragraph (3) are all of the following—
(a)
the worker resides in the family home of the worker’s employer;
(b)
the worker is not a member of that family, but is treated as such, in particular as regards to the provision of living accommodation and meals and the sharing of tasks and leisure activities;
(c)
the worker is neither liable to any deduction, nor to make any payment to the employer, or any other person, as respects the provision of the living accommodation or meals;
(d)
if the work had been done by a member of the employer’s family, it would not be treated as work or as performed under a worker’s contract because the requirements in regulation 57(2) would be met. The requirements in regulation 57(2) are all of the following: the worker is a member of the employer’s family; the worker resides in the family home of the employer; the worker shares in the tasks and activities of the family.
Upon commencement of this instrument, any work which meets the requirements set out in paragraph (3) will be included as “work” for the purposes of the 2015 Regulations. This will mean that from 1st April 2024 a worker must be remunerated in respect of any such work in a pay reference period (as defined by regulation 6 of the 2015 Regulations) at a rate which is not less than the national minimum wage (as set out in Part 2 of the 2015 Regulations).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. Instead a de minimis assessment has been prepared as this instrument is likely to entail some costs for businesses, but the net impact is estimated to be below £5 million per year.","{'category': 'May contain legislation that applies to NothernIreland', 'country': 'NothernIreland', 'file': 'The National Minimum Wage (Amendment) Regulations 2024.txt', 'legislation': 'UK Statutory Instruments', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2024/75/note/made', 'year': '2024'}","Prospective

NothernIreland,"An employee in NothernIreland has recently lost a child and is unsure about their entitlement to bereavement leave and pay. Under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022, what are their rights, and how can they access them?","Under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022, an employee in NothernIreland who has recently lost a child is entitled to bereavement leave, and if they meet certain criteria, they may also be eligible for bereavement pay. Article 112EA(1)-(3) defines a ""bereaved parent"" as an employee who meets specified relationship conditions with the deceased child, which may include a caregiving role before the child’s death. Employees who lose a child under 18, or experience a stillbirth after 24 weeks of pregnancy, are entitled to at least two weeks of bereavement leave under Article 112EA(5). This leave can be taken either as a single two-week block or in two separate one-week periods. According to Article 112EA(6), this leave must be taken within at least 56 days (eight weeks) from the date of the child’s death, providing flexibility within that period.
If an employee loses more than one child, Article 112EA(7) entitles them to bereavement leave for each child. Article 112EB outlines rights during and after bereavement leave, specifying that employees on leave retain most employment terms and conditions (excluding remuneration). According to Article 112EB(1)(a)-(c), employees are entitled to return to their original or an equivalent job after bereavement leave. Furthermore, Article 112EB(3) provides that if bereavement leave coincides with other types of parental leave (such as maternity or paternity leave), the right to return applies across the entire period of absence.
To access bereavement leave, Article 112ED(a) requires employees to notify their employer as soon as reasonably practicable, specifying the intended dates for leave. Employers are obligated to grant this leave and cannot delay or refuse it. If the employee is also eligible for statutory bereavement pay, they must provide notice and any required documentation as directed under Articles 112ED(a) and (c).","

Under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, an employee in Northern Ireland who has recently lost a child has specific entitlements:

### Types of Entitlements:
1. **Unpaid Bereavement Leave:**
   - The employee is entitled to up to 90 off-peak days (typically Monday to Friday, 7 AM to 7 PM) of unpaid leave following the loss of a child.

2. **Statutory Paid Bereavement Leave:**
   - For the first 30 working days after the loss, the employer must pay the employee at 90% of their salary.
   - This is subject to the employer's verification of eligibility and the provision of necessary evidence.

### Eligibility Criteria:
- The employee must inform their employer about the loss within a reasonable timeframe (typically through notification).
- They should provide evidence, such as a death certificate or birth certification, to confirm the child's existence and the circumstances of the loss.
- The employer has 28 days to respond after receiving this information.

### Process for Accessing Entitlements:
1. **Notification:** Inform the employer promptly about the loss and express the need for leave.
2. **Evidence Submission:** Provide necessary documentation to support the claim.
3. **Employer Verification:** Wait for the employer to review and confirm eligibility, which typically takes 28 days.

### Employer Responsibilities:
- The employer must respond within 28 days of receiving evidence, providing details of any non-liability decision.
- If the employee is entitled to paid leave, the employer must process this within the specified timeframe.

### Considerations:
- **Comparison with Great Britain:** Similarities exist in entitlements and processes, though specific local regulations may vary.
- **Support Services:** Resources from organizations like the Department of Economy or Citizens Advice can provide additional guidance.

### Practical Steps:
- Contact your employer to initiate the notification process.
- Seek support from relevant authorities or advice agencies for navigating the application process.

This summary outlines the key aspects and steps involved in accessing bereavement leave and pay under the Act, emphasizing the importance of timely communication with employers and the provision of necessary evidence.","['', ' Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022']",23,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers inserted into the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 (N.I. 16) (the “1996 Order”) by the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 (c. 5).
The Regulations revoke and re-enact the provisions of the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023 which would otherwise cease to have effect by virtue of Article 251(1A) of the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996.
These Regulations provide for a statutory entitlement for bereaved parents who are employees to take up to two weeks’ leave from their job called parental bereavement leave in the 56 weeks following the death of a child.
Part 2 relates to entitlement to parental bereavement leave. The right to take parental bereavement leave is conferred by regulation 4 which sets out the conditions for entitlement which must be satisfied by the employee in order to take parental bereavement leave. These include substantive requirements, such as the employee falling within the definition of a bereaved parent (in particular, specifying the types of parental relationships in respect of which the new entitlement arises), as well as procedural requirements, such as the employee giving appropriate notices to their employer. Where an employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave under regulation 4 as the result of the death of more than one child, the employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave in respect of each child.
Regulation 5 sets out the number of weeks of parental bereavement leave that are available to a bereaved parent and gives an employee the option of taking either one or two weeks’ parental bereavement leave. The weeks taken as parental bereavement leave do not need to be taken consecutively. It also provides that parental bereavement leave may only be taken within the period of 56 weeks beginning with the date of the child’s death.
Regulation 6 details the notice requirements and other information the bereaved parent must provide to their employer before taking parental bereavement leave. An employee does not need to provide notice in writing to his or her employer, but the length of notice required to book and cancel parental bereavement leave will vary depending on whether the period the employee intends to take as parental bereavement leave falls within 56 days of the child’s death or later. Regulations 7 and 8 respectively set out when an employee’s period of bereavement leave may start and what happens when a period of parental bereavement leave is interrupted by another type of statutory leave under Part 9 of the 1996 Order.
Part 3 contains provisions applicable in relation to the taking of parental bereavement leave. Regulation 9 elaborates on the new Article 112EB of the 1996 Order, by providing that an employee is entitled during his or her absence on leave to the benefit of all of his or her terms and conditions of employment apart from the right to remuneration (excluded by Article 112EB(2)(b)); also that the employee is subject to all of the obligations under those terms and conditions except in so far as they are inconsistent with the right to take parental bereavement leave (the exception appears in Article 112EB(1)(b)). Regulations 10 and 11 provide for an employee’s right to return to work after taking a period of parental bereavement leave, distinguishing the case where the leave was an isolated period of absence from the case where it followed another period of statutory leave. Regulations 12 and 13 provide that an employee entitled to parental bereavement leave is protected from detriment and dismissal attributable to the fact that they took or sought to take parental bereavement leave.
Part 4 contains provisions applicable where an employee has a contractual right to parental bereavement leave, in addition to the statutory right contained within these Regulations.
Part 5 (regulations 16 to 22) contains provisions in respect of the Transitional arrangements that will ensure a continuity of entitlement between the revoked Regulations and current Regulations. This part also contains the revocation of the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023.

NothernIreland,"A tenant in NothernIreland has been served an eviction notice by their landlord, giving them four weeks to vacate the property. The tenant has lived there for two years under a periodic tenancy. Under the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, is the notice period valid, and what rights does the tenant have?","Under the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, a landlord’s notice to quit a property must meet specific statutory notice periods based on the length of the tenancy. This Act amends the Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006, particularly Article 14, to reflect updated notice requirements. For a tenant who has lived in the property for two years under a periodic tenancy, Section 11 of the 2022 Act amends Article 14 of the 2006 Order to specify that the landlord must provide at least 4 months’ notice before requiring the tenant to vacate. This 4-month period applies to tenancies that have existed for more than 12 months but not more than 3 years (as outlined in the new Article 14(1A)(b)). Because the landlord provided only four weeks’ notice, this does not satisfy the legal requirement, rendering the notice invalid. The tenant has the right to remain in the property until a valid notice to quit is served that meets the legally required notice period. Under Section 11 of the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, which amends Article 14 of the Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006, landlords are required to give a minimum 4-month notice for tenancies that have lasted more than 12 months but not more than 3 years. Because the tenant has lived in the property for two years, the landlord’s four-week notice does not meet this requirement and is therefore invalid. The tenant may choose to inform the landlord in writing that the notice is invalid due to the insufficient notice period, referencing Article 14(1), which states that a notice to quit is only valid if it complies with the minimum notice periods required by law. If the landlord proceeds with eviction attempts despite the invalid notice, the tenant may seek legal remedies. While specific injunctions or protections against harassment are not outlined within this tenancy legislation, the tenant may still seek legal assistance through broader NothernIreland housing or civil law protections to prevent an unlawful eviction and maintain peaceful possession of the property.","

Under the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, a four-week eviction notice served on a periodic tenancy is invalid. Here's a structured overview:

1. **Validity of Notice**: The minimum notice period required for termination of a periodic tenancy under the 2022 Act is six months. Since the landlord only provided four weeks, the notice is insufficient and therefore invalid.

2. **Tenant Rights**: 
   - **Challenge in Court**: The tenant has the right to challenge the validity of the eviction notice in court. They can argue that the notice period was too short.
   - **Defending Against Eviction**: The tenant can contest the eviction on the grounds of unfairness, especially if they believe the landlord's reasons are unjustified or if there are protections applicable (e.g., due to COVID-19 or anti-social behavior concerns).

3. **Additional Protections**:
   - **COVID-19 Considerations**: While some COVID-19 related protections might have expired, it's crucial to check for any residual regulations from the Department for Communities that could still offer tenant safeguards.
   - **Grounds for Eviction**: If eviction is due to reasons like rent arrears or anti-social behavior, these may be subject to specific procedures and protections under the Act.

4. **Tenancy Type**: As a periodic tenancy with no fixed end date, the landlord cannot terminate it without meeting the statutory notice requirements. The four-week notice does not meet this criterion, making it legally insufficient.

In summary, the eviction notice is invalid due to insufficient notice period, and the tenant has legal rights to contest this decision in court.","['', ' Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022 ', ' Section 11\r\n', ' Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006 ', ' Article 14']",23,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

These Regulations protect tenants from eviction for a reasonable and specified period of time and provide that landlords must give their tenants at least 12 weeks’ notice to quit a dwelling house let under a private tenancy.","{'category': 'Exclusively or primarily applies to NothernIreland', 'country': 'NothernIreland', 'file': 'The Private Tenancies (Coronavirus Modifications) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2020.txt', 'legislation': 'Northern Ireland Statutory Rules', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/2020/192/note/made', 'year': '2020'}","Prospective

NothernIreland,"An individual in NothernIreland is being harassed and stalked by an ex-partner, causing them significant distress. Under the Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022, what legal protections are available to them, and what steps should they take to ensure their safety?","Under the Protection from Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022, individuals in NothernIreland who are being harassed and stalked by an ex-partner can rely on specific legal protections. The Act clearly defines stalking as a criminal offense in Section 1, where engaging in a course of conduct causing another person to experience fear, alarm, or substantial distress constitutes stalking. Such conduct includes following, contacting, monitoring usage of electronic communications, and other invasive behaviors. Offenders can face severe penalties, with up to 10 years imprisonment or a fine upon conviction on indictment, or up to 12 months imprisonment or a statutory maximum fine upon summary conviction. Additionally, the Act allows for Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs), detailed in Section 7, which the Chief Constable can apply for. These orders are designed to prevent further stalking activities by imposing specific prohibitions or requirements on the stalker. The eligibility for an SPO is based on evidence that the individual has engaged in stalking, poses a risk related to stalking, and that the order is necessary to protect someone from this risk. These orders can be applied against anyone residing in, or intending to visit, NothernIreland. The duration of these orders is addressed in Section 9, where an SPO can last for a minimum of two years or until further court order. The court may specify that some conditions within the SPO remain effective until further judicial review while setting others for fixed periods. This flexibility allows the protective measures to be adapted over time to match the needs of the situation. For their safety, affected individuals should report stalking incidents to the Police Service of NothernIreland (PSNI), enabling legal proceedings that could include the issuance of an SPO. Consulting legal advice and engaging with support services are also advisable steps to ensure comprehensive protection and support.","

**Legal Protections and Safety Measures for a Victim of Stalking in Northern Ireland**

**1. Legal Protections Under the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022:**
   - **Definition of Stalking:** The act explicitly outlines behaviors such as following, monitoring, waiting, or loitering near someone's home.
   - **Criminal Offense:** Stalking is a criminal offense under the new Act, which can lead to legal action and penalties for the harasser.

**2. Available Legal Remedies:**
   - **Police Complaint:** The individual should report harassment and stalking to the police. This step is crucial for potential criminal charges against the ex-partner.
   - **Injunctions:** They can apply for a civil Injunction through the courts to prevent further contact or proximity from the harasser. This can be done at no cost.

**3. Civil Law Protections:**
   - **Protection Orders:** Courts may issue Protection Orders to prevent harassment and stalking, potentially including both criminal and civil aspects.
   - **Support Organizations:** NGOs and support groups can offer assistance, counseling, and advice on safety measures.

**4. Safety Measures:**
   - **Avoid Routines:** Adjust daily routines to minimize the risk of being followed or monitored.
   - **Use of Technology:** Install security systems at home and consider using apps for location tracking.
   - **Document Evidence:** Keep a detailed record of incidents, including dates, times, locations, and any evidence like photos or messages.

**5. Mental Health Support:**
   - **Counseling Services:** Access professional help to manage stress and trauma. Crisis centers in Northern Ireland can provide immediate support.

**6. Considerations for Cross-Border Issues:**
   - **Joint Arrangements:** Police forces may collaborate across borders if the harasser resides elsewhere in the UK.
   - **Evidence Collection:** Maintain a comprehensive record of all incidents, as this could be vital for legal proceedings.

**7. Legal Consequences for Harassers:**
   - **Penalties:** Violations of Protection Orders can lead to fines and imprisonment, emphasizing the seriousness of the law against stalking.

In summary, victims in Northern Ireland have access to both criminal and civil remedies under the Stalking Act 2022 and related legislation. Proactive steps such as reporting incidents, seeking injunctions, and adopting safety measures are essential for protection. Seeking support from legal and mental health services is also crucial for recovery and well-being.","['', ' Protection from Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022']",23,True,"Meaning of act associated with stalking and risk associated with stalking
