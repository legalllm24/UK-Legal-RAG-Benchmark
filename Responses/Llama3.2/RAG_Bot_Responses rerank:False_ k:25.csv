Unitedkingdom,"An employee in England is currently on maternity leave under the Employment Rights Act 1996. During her leave, her employer announces a redundancy process due to company restructuring. Additionally, there are health and safety concerns at the workplace that might affect her return. Considering the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (as amended), the Equality Act 2010, the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, and relevant case law, what protections does she have during redundancy, and how should the employer proceed?","Under the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999, specifically Regulation 10, if an employee on maternity leave is at risk of redundancy, she must be offered any suitable alternative vacancy available before it is offered to other employees, giving her priority for redeployment opportunities. The Equality Act 2010, particularly Section 18, prohibits discrimination because of pregnancy or maternity, requiring employers to ensure that redundancy selection criteria do not disadvantage employees on maternity leave to avoid unlawful discrimination claims. Regarding health and safety, the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, Regulation 16, mandates employers to perform a specific risk assessment for new or expectant mothers, and if risks are identified and cannot be avoided, the employer must adjust her working conditions or hours, offer suitable alternative work on no less favorable terms, or if no alternative is available, suspend her on full pay. Relevant case law, such as Sefton Borough Council v Wainwright [2014] EWCA Civ 953, confirms the obligation to offer suitable alternative employment to employees on maternity leave before others. Therefore, the employer must conduct a fair and non-discriminatory redundancy process, prioritize the employee for any suitable alternative positions, and address health and safety concerns by performing risk assessments and taking necessary actions to protect the employee.","This question requires an analysis of multiple employment laws and regulations in the United Kingdom. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Maternity Leave**: The employee is on maternity leave under the Employment Rights Act 1996. This means she is entitled to Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) and has limited liability for any loss of earnings.

2. **Redundancy Process**: Her employer announces a redundancy process due to company restructuring. 

3. **Health and Safety Concerns**: There are health and safety concerns at the workplace that might affect her return.

4. **Equal Protection under Law**: The Equality Act 2010 (EA) prohibits discrimination on grounds of pregnancy, maternity, or childbirth. Therefore, if the employer's decision to carry out redundancy is motivated by the employee's pregnancy or maternity leave status, it may be considered discriminatory and unlawful.

5. **Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999**: The EA also requires employers to take reasonable care for the health, safety, and welfare of employees. If the workplace poses a risk to the employee’s return due to health and safety concerns, the employer must take steps to mitigate these risks or provide alternative arrangements.

6. **Protections during Redundancy**:
    - The employee may have protection under the EA if her redundancy is directly related to her pregnancy or maternity leave status.
    - She should also be entitled to SMP and potentially enhanced statutory maternity pay (ESMP) due to her pregnancy, which could reduce any loss of earnings from redundancy.

7. **Employer’s Obligations**:
    - The employer must follow the EA's non-discrimination provisions when making redundancy decisions.
    - They must assess whether the health and safety risks can be mitigated or provide alternative arrangements for the employee to return safely, if possible.
    - If an immediate return is not feasible due to safety concerns, they should offer a suitable alternative (e.g., flexible working arrangements) in accordance with the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations.

8. **Next Steps**:
    - The employer should communicate clearly with the employee about the redundancy process and the reasons behind it.
    - If there are health and safety concerns affecting her return, they must engage in open discussions to find a solution that minimizes risk while respecting her employment rights.
    - To avoid discrimination claims under the EA, ensure any decisions made during this time do not unfairly penalize or disadvantage pregnant employees.

This analysis indicates the employee has several protections during redundancy due to her pregnancy and maternity leave. The employer must comply with both the Employment Rights Act 1996 (regarding redundancies) and the Equality Act 2010 (for discrimination protection), as well as the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, ensuring a fair process that considers health and safety risks while respecting her employment rights.","['', ' Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999, Regulation 10\r\n', ' Equality Act 2010, Section 18\r\n', ' Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, Regulation 16']",25,False,"1

These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers inserted into the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 (N.I. 16) (the “1996 Order”) by the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 (c. 5).
The Regulations revoke and re-enact the provisions of the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023 which would otherwise cease to have effect by virtue of Article 251(1A) of the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996.
These Regulations provide for a statutory entitlement for bereaved parents who are employees to take up to two weeks’ leave from their job called parental bereavement leave in the 56 weeks following the death of a child.
Part 2 relates to entitlement to parental bereavement leave. The right to take parental bereavement leave is conferred by regulation 4 which sets out the conditions for entitlement which must be satisfied by the employee in order to take parental bereavement leave. These include substantive requirements, such as the employee falling within the definition of a bereaved parent (in particular, specifying the types of parental relationships in respect of which the new entitlement arises), as well as procedural requirements, such as the employee giving appropriate notices to their employer. Where an employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave under regulation 4 as the result of the death of more than one child, the employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave in respect of each child.
Regulation 5 sets out the number of weeks of parental bereavement leave that are available to a bereaved parent and gives an employee the option of taking either one or two weeks’ parental bereavement leave. The weeks taken as parental bereavement leave do not need to be taken consecutively. It also provides that parental bereavement leave may only be taken within the period of 56 weeks beginning with the date of the child’s death.
Regulation 6 details the notice requirements and other information the bereaved parent must provide to their employer before taking parental bereavement leave. An employee does not need to provide notice in writing to his or her employer, but the length of notice required to book and cancel parental bereavement leave will vary depending on whether the period the employee intends to take as parental bereavement leave falls within 56 days of the child’s death or later. Regulations 7 and 8 respectively set out when an employee’s period of bereavement leave may start and what happens when a period of parental bereavement leave is interrupted by another type of statutory leave under Part 9 of the 1996 Order.
Part 3 contains provisions applicable in relation to the taking of parental bereavement leave. Regulation 9 elaborates on the new Article 112EB of the 1996 Order, by providing that an employee is entitled during his or her absence on leave to the benefit of all of his or her terms and conditions of employment apart from the right to remuneration (excluded by Article 112EB(2)(b)); also that the employee is subject to all of the obligations under those terms and conditions except in so far as they are inconsistent with the right to take parental bereavement leave (the exception appears in Article 112EB(1)(b)). Regulations 10 and 11 provide for an employee’s right to return to work after taking a period of parental bereavement leave, distinguishing the case where the leave was an isolated period of absence from the case where it followed another period of statutory leave. Regulations 12 and 13 provide that an employee entitled to parental bereavement leave is protected from detriment and dismissal attributable to the fact that they took or sought to take parental bereavement leave.
Part 4 contains provisions applicable where an employee has a contractual right to parental bereavement leave, in addition to the statutory right contained within these Regulations.
Part 5 (regulations 16 to 22) contains provisions in respect of the Transitional arrangements that will ensure a continuity of entitlement between the revoked Regulations and current Regulations. This part also contains the revocation of the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023.
A separate impact assessment has not been prepared for these Regulations. The Regulations are part of a package of legislative measures and the relevant impact assessment is the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill impact assessment which was published in April 2020.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations introduce a new statutory entitlement for bereaved parents who are employees to take up to two weeks’ leave from their job called parental bereavement leave in the 56 weeks following the death of a child. These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers inserted into the Employment Rights Act 1996 (c. 18) (the “1996 Act”) by the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay Act) 2018 (c. 24).
Part 2 relates to entitlement to parental bereavement leave. The right to take parental bereavement leave is conferred by regulation 4 which sets out the conditions for entitlement which must be satisfied by the employee in order to take parental bereavement leave. These include substantive requirements, such as the employee falling within the definition of a bereaved parent (in particular, specifying the types of parental relationships in respect of which the new entitlement arises), as well as procedural requirements, such as the employee giving appropriate notices to their employer. Where an employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave under regulation 4 as the result of the death of more than one child, the employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave in respect of each child.
Regulation 5 sets out the number of weeks of parental bereavement leave that are available to a bereaved parent and gives an employee the option of taking either one or two weeks’ parental bereavement leave. The weeks taken as parental bereavement leave do not need to be taken consecutively. It also provides that parental bereavement leave may only be taken within the period of 56 weeks beginning with the date of the child’s death.
Regulation 6 details the notice requirements and other information the bereaved parent must provide to their employer before taking parental bereavement leave. An employee does not need to provide notice in writing to his or her employer, but the length of notice required to book and cancel parental bereavement leave will vary depending on whether the period the employee intends to take as parental bereavement leave falls within 56 days of the child’s death or later. Regulations 7 and 8 respectively set out when an employee’s period of bereavement leave may start and what happens when a period of parental bereavement leave is interrupted by another type of statutory leave under Part 8 of the 1996 Act.
Part 3 contains provisions applicable in relation to the taking of parental bereavement leave. Regulation 9 elaborates on the new section 80EB of the 1996 Act, by providing that an employee is entitled during his or her absence on leave to the benefit of all of his or her terms and conditions of employment apart from the right to remuneration (excluded by Section 80EB(3)(b)); also that the employee is subject to all of the obligations under those terms and conditions except in so far as they are inconsistent with the right to take parental bereavement leave (the exception appears in section 80EB(1)(b)). Regulations 10 and 11 provide for an employee’s right to return to work after taking a period of parental bereavement leave, distinguishing the case where the leave was an isolated period of absence from the case where it followed another period of statutory leave. Regulations 12 and 13 provide that an employee entitled to parental bereavement leave is protected from detriment and dismissal attributable to the fact that they took or sought to take parental bereavement leave.
Part 4 contains provisions applicable where an employee has a contractual right to parental bereavement leave, in addition to the statutory right contained within these Regulations.
These Regulations are part of a package of legislative measures and the relevant impact assessment is the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill impact assessment which was published on 14 May 2018.

Unitedkingdom,"A tenant in England reports a malfunctioning carbon monoxide alarm installed under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (Amendment) Regulations 2022. Despite notifying the landlord, the alarm has not been repaired or replaced after three weeks. The tenant is concerned about safety and compliance. Under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm Regulations 2015 (as amended), what are the landlord's legal obligations, and what actions can the tenant take?","Under Regulation 6 of the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015, when a landlord is served with a remedial notice for breaching one or more duties outlined in Regulation 4(1) (such as failing to install or maintain smoke or carbon monoxide alarms), the landlord must take the specified remedial actions within the timeframe set out in Regulation 5(2)(d), typically 28 days from the notice's issuance. This regulation imposes a clear duty on the landlord to address the breach promptly and ensures tenant safety through enforcement mechanisms. However, Regulation 6(2) provides that a landlord will not be considered in breach of this obligation if they can demonstrate that they have taken all reasonable steps, short of initiating legal proceedings, to comply with the duty. Reasonable steps may include hiring contractors, arranging access to the property, or documenting efforts to resolve tenant-related barriers to compliance. Proper evidence of these steps is crucial to establish the landlord’s diligence. This provision ensures that while landlords are held accountable, genuine efforts to comply are recognized, even if the issue remains unresolved due to circumstances beyond their control.","Under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm Regulations 2015 (as amended) in England, landlords have a duty to provide working carbon monoxide alarms in rental properties. 

Landlord's Legal Obligations:

1. Provide a smoke alarm on every storey (level) and in every room where sleeping accommodation is located.
2. Provide additional alarms at the top of every external staircase leading to a storey that contains sleeping accommodation.

If the tenant reports a malfunctioning carbon monoxide alarm, the landlord must take steps to repair or replace it within three months of receiving notice. 

Tenant's Actions:

1. Inform the landlord about the issue: The tenant has already done this.
2. Send formal warning letter: The tenant should write a formal letter to the landlord reminding them of their responsibilities under the regulations and requesting that they repair or replace the alarm.
3. Contact local authorities (if necessary): If the landlord fails to respond or take action, the tenant can contact local authorities, such as environmental health officers or housing enforcement officers, for assistance.
4. Report the issue to the local authority: The tenant should report the issue to their local authority, which may conduct an inspection and enforce compliance with the regulations.

Note that the specific actions and timescales may vary depending on the circumstances of each case. It is essential for tenants to document all correspondence and interactions with landlords and seek guidance from local authorities if needed.","['', ' Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015 – Regulation 6: Duty of Relevant Landlord to Comply with a Remedial Notice\r\n', ' Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015 – Regulation 4: Duties of Landlords\r\n', ' Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015 – Regulation 5: Remedial Notices']",25,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Unitedkingdom,"An apprentice in England has turned 19 and has completed the first year of their apprenticeship. However, they are still being paid the apprenticeship wage, which is lower than the National Minimum Wage for their age. Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 (as amended) and the National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015, what are the apprentice's rights regarding wages, and what steps can they take if their employer is not compliant?","An apprentice in England has turned 19 and has completed the first year of their apprenticeship. However, they are still being paid the apprenticeship wage, which is lower than the National Minimum Wage for their age. Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 (as amended) and the National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015, what are the apprentice's rights regarding wages, and what steps can they take if their employer is not compliant?","The apprentice has a right to be paid at least the minimum wage for their age group. The National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015 provide that employers must pay their employees, including apprentices, the relevant minimum wage.

Since the apprentice has turned 19, they are now entitled to the adult rate of National Minimum Wage. However, if they are still being paid the lower apprentice rate, they have the right to claim this as an underpayment and seek redress from their employer.

The apprentice can take the following steps:

1. Review their employment contract: The apprentice should check their contract to see if it includes a clause specifying that they will be paid at least the minimum wage for their age group.
2. Calculate the amount owed: The apprentice should calculate how much they have been underpaid and what they are entitled to receive.
3. Talk to their employer: The apprentice should discuss the issue with their employer, explaining that they believe they are entitled to the higher rate of National Minimum Wage due to their age and completion of their apprenticeship.
4. Seek support from a relevant authority: If talking to their employer does not resolve the issue, the apprentice can contact a relevant authority, such as the UK's Apprenticeship Service or Acas (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service), for guidance and potential support.
5. Consider formal action: If the issue is not resolved through discussion with the employer, the apprentice may need to consider taking formal action, such as claiming underpayment and seeking compensation.

It's essential for the apprentice to keep records of their employment, including pay stubs and any communication with their employer, to support their claim if they decide to pursue formal action.","['', ' National Minimum Wage Act 1998:\r\n', ' Employment Rights Act 1996, Section 13:\r\n', ' National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015, Regulation 5(1)']",25,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Unitedkingdom,"Residents in an English town are concerned that their local authority has not implemented separate food waste collections, as required by the Environment Act 2021. The deadline has passed, and there is no plan in place. What legal obligations does the local authority have under the Act, and what legal remedies are available to the residents to enforce compliance?","Under the Environment Act 2021, specifically Section 57, which inserts Section 45AZB into the Environmental Protection Act 1990, local authorities in England are legally obligated to arrange for the separate collection of food waste from households; failure to do so constitutes a breach of statutory duty. Residents can raise the issue with the local authority by submitting formal complaints requesting compliance, engage with local councillors and Members of Parliament (MPs) to advocate for action, and may have standing to apply for a judicial review of the local authority's failure to comply with statutory duties, as established in cases like R (on the application of Greenpeace Ltd) v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1998] Env LR 415; they must act promptly and within three months of the grounds arising.","The local authority is subject to the provisions of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (c. 43), which includes the requirement for separate food waste collections. Specifically, sections 45A(5), 45AZA(5), and 45AZB(5) of the Act require that recyclable household waste and relevant waste in each recyclable waste stream be collected separately.

The residents can take the following legal remedies to enforce compliance:

1. **Complaint to the local authority**: The residents can write to the local authority, expressing their concerns about not having separate food waste collections. They should request an explanation for the lack of implementation and a timeline for when it will be introduced.
2. **Request under Section 34(2) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990**: This section allows individuals to make representations to the Secretary of State regarding breaches of environmental regulations by local authorities. The residents can submit their concerns in writing to the Secretary of State, who may investigate and take action if necessary.
3. **Complaint to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)**: If the local authority fails to respond or comply with the residents' requests, they can refer the matter to the EPA. The EPA is responsible for enforcing environmental regulations at a national level in the United Kingdom.
4. **Petition to the High Court**: If the local authority still refuses to implement separate food waste collections, the residents can consider petitioning the High Court for judicial review. This involves demonstrating that the decision-making process was flawed and that the local authority acted unlawfully.
5. **Seeking assistance from environmental organizations**: The residents may be able to seek guidance and support from environmental organizations or advocacy groups that specialize in waste management and recycling.

It is essential for the residents to document their concerns, including dates, times, and details of conversations with the local authority. They should also gather evidence to support their claims, such as witness statements, photographs, or records of correspondence.","['', ' Environment Act 2021, Section 57 (inserting Section 45AZB into the Environmental Protection Act 1990)\r\n', ' Environmental Protection Act 1990, Section 45AZB (as inserted by the Environment Act 2021)']",25,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Regulation 2 brings into force on 17th May 2024 specified sections of the Act.
Section 57 of the Act amends the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (c. 43) (“the 1990 Act”) and the Environment Act 1995 (c. 25) (“the 1995 Act”). Subsection (4) substitutes new sections 45A to 45AZG for section 45A of the 1990 Act to introduce new requirements in England for the separate collection of household waste from domestic and relevant non-domestic premises, and of relevant waste. Subsections (5) and (6) amend sections 46(2) (receptacles for household waste) and 47(3) (receptacles for commercial or industrial waste) of the 1990 Act to enable English waste collection authorities to require the use of appropriate receptacles for the purposes of complying with the new duties under sections 45A to 45AZB of the 1990 Act. Subsection (8) amends the 1995 Act to enable the Environment Agency to make a charging scheme in relation to performing its functions relating to sections 45A to 45AZB of the 1990 Act.
Sections 74 to 77 of the Act provide for the Secretary of State to make regulations providing for the recall of relevant products, including motor vehicles, that do not meet relevant environmental standards.
Section 81 is commenced for the limited purpose of enabling regulations to be made under section 141DA into the Water Industry Act 1991 (c.56) (“the 1991 Act”).
Section 82(2), which is already partially commenced, makes consequential amendments to section 213 of the 1991 Act to include a reference to the regulation making powers of new sections 141DA and 141DB.
Regulation 3 brings into force section 79 of the Act on 1st September 2024 so far as relating to undertakers whose areas are wholly or mainly in England. Section 79 inserts new sections 94A to 94E into the 1991 Act, to introduce new requirements on sewerage undertakers to prepare, publish and maintain drainage and sewerage management plans.
Regulation 4 brings into force section 81 of the Act on 1st January 2025, for all remaining purposes. Section 81 inserts new section 141DA into the 1991 Act to establish a legal requirement for sewerage undertakers wholly or mainly in England to report in near real time on when a discharge starts and stops.
Regulation 5 makes transitional provision in connection with the commencement of section 57 of the Act in order to provide, in certain cases, an extended period for duty holders to comply with the new duties. In the meantime, English waste collection authorities must continue to comply with the requirements in section 45A(2) of the 1990 Act as it applied immediately before the coming into force of section 57 of the Act.
Regulations 6 and 7 make further transitional provisions in relation to the areas serviced by the English waste collection authorities that are specified in the first column of the Table in the Schedule. The duty holders in those areas have until the date specified for each authority in the corresponding entry in the second column of the Table in the Schedule to introduce separate food waste collections for domestic and relevant non-domestic premises. This is in order to account for existing long-term waste disposal contracts.
Regulation 6 also provides that the English waste collection authorities specified in the first column of the Table in the Schedule are not required to fully meet the condition in section 45A(3) of the 1990 Act until the date specified in the corresponding entry in the second column of the Table in the Schedule. The condition is that recyclable household waste must be collected separately from other household waste, in relation to the collection of garden waste, but only if the other household waste being collected with that garden waste is food waste.

These Regulations set exemptions from the condition set out in sections 45A(5), 45AZA(5) and 45AZB(5) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (c. 43) (“the Act”) such that any combination of the recyclable waste streams metal, glass, plastic, and paper and card can be collected together. They also make provision in respect of recyclable household waste, so that the recyclable waste streams food waste and garden waste can be collected together. These conditions require recyclable household waste and recyclable relevant waste in each recyclable waste stream to be collected separately, except so far as provided by sections 45A(6), 45AZA(6) and 45AZB(6) of the Act.
These Regulations also set an exemption from the application of sections 45AZA and 45AZB in respect of businesses which are micro-firms until 31st March 2027. A micro-firm is a business which has a full-time equivalent number of employees of less than ten. “Business” is defined for these purposes as meaning any person carrying on an activity or enterprise, whether or not for profit, from relevant non-domestic premises under section 45AZA(11) of the Act or from premises producing relevant waste to which section 45AZB of the Act applies. Businesses which meet this definition will not need to comply with any requirements in section 45AZA or section 45AZB as appropriate, until 31st March 2027.

Wales,"An employee lives in Wales but works in England. They are planning to take Shared Parental Leave (SPL) following the birth of their child. They are unsure how the differences between Welsh and English regulations might affect their entitlement and whether their residence in Wales impacts their rights. Under the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, what are their rights, and does their place of residence affect their entitlement? ","Under the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, which are authorized by the Employment Rights Act 1996, an employee's entitlement to Shared Parental Leave (SPL) is determined by their employment status and specific eligibility criteria, irrespective of their place of residence. The regulations apply uniformly across England and Wales. To qualify for SPL, the employee must have been continuously employed by the same employer for at least 26 weeks by the end of the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth and remain employed at the start of each period of SPL taken. Additionally, their partner must have worked (employed or self-employed) for at least 26 of the 66 weeks before the expected week of childbirth and have earned an average of at least £30 per week in 13 of those weeks. These criteria are outlined in the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, specifically in Part 2, Chapter 1, Regulation 6. Therefore, an employee residing in Wales and working in England is entitled to SPL, provided they meet these eligibility requirements, with their place of residence having no impact on their entitlement.","Under the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, an employee who lives in Wales but works in England would be entitled to take Shared Parental Leave if certain conditions are met. The key points to consider are:

1. **Eligibility**: The employee must have eligible leave rights under the Shared Parental Leave scheme.
2. **Employer's consent**: The employer must agree to the employee's request for Shared Parental Leave, considering business needs and other employees' interests.
3. **Leave period**: The employee can take up to 52 weeks of SPL per year, with a minimum leave period of one week.

Regarding residence in Wales:

**Welsh residency does not directly affect entitlement to SPL** under the English regulations. However, it's essential to consider the following points:

1. **Tax implications**: As an English employer, they may need to comply with Welsh tax laws, which could impact their ability to pay statutory parental bereavement pay (SPB).
2. **Employer obligations**: The English employer might have different contractual or regulatory requirements for employees living in Wales compared to those working from England.
3. **Leave arrangements**: While the employee's residence in Wales doesn't directly affect SPL entitlement, they should discuss their leave plans with their employer and understand any specific requirements or restrictions that may apply due to Welsh residency.

It is recommended that the employee:

1. Review their employment contract and familiarize themselves with any local regulations or requirements.
2. Consult with HR or their manager to clarify any specific procedures or conditions related to Shared Parental Leave in Wales.
3. Contact the relevant authorities (e.g., the Welsh Government's Employment Law Reform Unit) for guidance on tax implications, employer obligations, and other matters affecting their entitlement.

The employee should be aware that the rules and regulations surrounding SPL can vary between England and Wales. Consulting with HR or an employment law expert would help ensure they understand their rights and any applicable local requirements.","['', ' Employment Rights Act 1996:\r\n', ' Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014']",25,False,"Amendment of the Shared Parental Leave and Paternity and Adoption Leave (Adoptions from Overseas) Regulations 2014

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999/3312), the Paternity and Adoption Leave Regulations 2002 (S.I. 2002/2788) and the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/3050). They also amend the Paternity and Adoption Leave (Adoption from Overseas) Regulations 2003 (S.I. 2003/921) and the Shared Parental Leave and Paternity and Adoption Leave (Adoptions from Overseas) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/3092) to ensure equivalent provision for those adopting children from overseas.
The amendments extend existing requirements that apply to employers when redundancy situations arise where an employee is on maternity, adoption or shared parental leave, so that those requirements can also apply during pregnancy and for a period of time after that leave has ended. For those taking shared parental leave who have not taken maternity or adoption leave, there is a six-week threshold of continuous leave that needs to be met for the requirements to apply for a period of time after shared parental leave has ended. Where the six-week threshold is not met, the requirements apply during shared parental leave.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations relate to the treatment under Part 12ZD of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 of persons abroad, persons who work as mariners and persons who work on the continental shelf. The effect is that certain persons who would otherwise not fulfil the qualifying conditions for entitlement to statutory parental bereavement pay because of the nature of their employment or the fact that they are outside the United Kingdom will have an entitlement to such pay.
Regulation 4 limits the application of the Regulations to cases where the person would be treated as an employee under Part 12ZD of the Act if the employment were in Great Britain.
Regulation 5 provides for a person employed in a State of the European Economic Area but subject to the legislation of the United Kingdom to be treated as an employee for the purposes of Part 12ZD.
Regulation 6 provides for a person who is absent from Great Britain but in respect of whom an employer has secondary Class 1 national insurance contribution liability to be treated as an employee for the purposes of the Part 12ZD.
Where a person has worked for the same employer both in Great Britain and in a State of the European Economic Area, regulation 7 provides, in specified circumstances, for employment in the Member State to be treated as employed earner’s employment for the purposes of Part 12ZD.
Regulation 8 relaxes any time limit imposed by Part 12ZD of the Act or regulations made under it in relation to a person who cannot comply with the time limit because that person is outside the United Kingdom.
Regulation 9 treats certain classes of mariners as employees for the purposes of Part 12ZD and regulation 10 makes corresponding provision for persons working on the continental shelf.
An impact assessment has not been prepared for these Regulations. These Regulations are part of a package of legislative measures and the relevant impact assessment is the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill impact assessment which was published on 14 May 2018.

Wales,"A tenant in Wales is experiencing severe damp and mold in their rented property, which the landlord has failed to address despite repeated requests. Under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, what are the landlord's obligations regarding repairs and safety, and what actions can the tenant take to enforce these obligations?","Under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, landlords are obligated to maintain rental properties in a condition fit for human habitation. Specifically, Section 91 mandates that landlords must ensure the dwelling is fit for human habitation both at the start and throughout the duration of the tenancy. Section 92 requires landlords to keep in repair the structure and exterior of the dwelling, including drains, gutters, and external pipes, and to maintain installations for the supply of water, gas, electricity, sanitation, space heating, and heating water. If a landlord fails to address severe damp and mold despite repeated requests, the tenant should notify the landlord in writing, keeping records of all communications. If the landlord remains unresponsive, the tenant can contact the local authority's Environmental Health department, which can inspect the property and issue improvement notices. Additionally, the tenant may apply to the court for an order requiring the landlord to carry out repairs. It's advisable to seek legal advice before considering actions like withholding rent or arranging for repairs independently, as these carry legal risks.","Under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, the landlord has obligations regarding repairs and safety. According to regulations 5-8, the landlord must:

1. Provide working smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms in the dwelling.
2. Inspect electrical service installations at intervals of no more than 5 years and maintain a record of the inspection results.
3. Ensure that any works carried out on the electrical service installations are done so in accordance with the inspection results.

If the landlord fails to comply with these regulations, the dwelling will be treated as if it were unfit for human habitation, and the tenant can take action to enforce these obligations.

The tenant can:

1. Request the landlord to carry out repairs or safety improvements.
2. Provide written notice to the landlord of any defects or hazards in the dwelling.
3. Take steps to secure the dwelling if it is uninhabitable due to lack of heat, light, water, sanitation, or other essential facilities.

If the landlord fails to respond or comply with the tenant's requests, the tenant can:

1. Contact a local housing authority for assistance and advice.
2. Seek a court order to compel the landlord to carry out necessary repairs.
3. Consider terminating the tenancy agreement if the situation does not improve.

It is essential for tenants in Wales to be aware of their rights under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016 and to take proactive steps to ensure their rented property is safe and habitable.","['', "" Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, Section 91: Landlord's obligation: fitness for human habitation\r\n"", "" Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, Section 92: Landlord's obligation to keep dwelling in repair""]",25,False,"Repairs

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Section 91 of the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016 (anaw 1) (“the Act”) requires a landlord, under a secure contract, a periodic standard contract or a fixed term standard contract made for a term of less than 7 years, to ensure that the dwelling is fit for human habitation, and section 92 requires the landlord to keep the dwelling in repair.
Section 94(1) requires the Welsh Ministers to prescribe matters and circumstances to which regard must be had when determining whether a dwelling is fit for human habitation, and section 94(2) enables the Welsh Ministers to prescribe matters and circumstances which may arise because of a landlord’s failure to keep the dwelling in repair. Section 94(3) enables the Welsh Ministers to impose requirements on landlords for the purpose of preventing those matters or circumstances from arising and to prescribe that if those requirements are not complied with, the dwelling is to be treated as if it were unfit for human habitation.
Regulation 3 and the Schedule prescribe the matters and circumstances to which regard must be had when determining whether a dwelling is fit for human habitation. This includes certain matters and circumstances which may arise because of a landlord’s failure to keep the dwelling in repair.
Regulation 4 provides that regulations 5 to 8 apply in relation to a secure contract, a periodic standard contract or a fixed term standard contract made for a term of less than 7 years, and which incorporate section 91 of the Act as a term of the contract. Regulation 4 applies regulations 5 to 8 to the same kinds of occupation contract as regulation 3.
Regulations 5 and 6 impose requirements on a landlord for the purpose of preventing any matters or circumstances which may cause a dwelling to be unfit for human habitation from arising.
Regulation 5 requires that smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms, in repair and proper working order, are present in a dwelling.
Regulation 6 requires that the electrical service installations in a dwelling are subject to inspection and testing (“an electrical safety inspection”) by a qualified person at intervals of 5 years or less; and that a copy of the condition report setting out the results of the electrical safety inspection is given to the contract-holder. If works are carried out on a dwelling’s electrical service installations between electrical safety inspections, the landlord must ensure that the contract-holder is given written confirmation that the works have been carried out.
Where a landlord fails to comply with a requirement imposed by regulation 5 or 6, the dwelling is to be treated as if it were unfit for human habitation; and the dwelling will continue to be treated as if it were unfit for human habitation under those regulations until the failure has been rectified by the landlord (see Part 4 of the Act for further provision about circumstances in which the obligations and liabilities of a landlord under that Part arise). If the failure re-occurs after rectification, the dwelling will again be treated as unfit for human habitation until it is rectified.
The landlord is in any event subject to the obligations in section 92 of the Act (if incorporated into the occupation contract) to keep electrical service installations in repair and proper working order. Those obligations will be relevant where an electrical safety inspection reveals that there are issues with an installation.
Regulation 7 makes provision about how these regulations operate in relation to existing tenancies and licences that become occupation contracts when the Act comes into force. Landlords under those contracts will have additional time within which to ensure compliance.
Regulation 8 makes provision relating to regulation 6, allowing landlords to rely on electrical condition reports obtained before these Regulations come into force.

Wales,"A retailer in Wales is found selling alcohol below the minimum unit price set by the Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018. They argue that discounts and promotions allow them to reduce prices. What does the Act stipulate regarding minimum alcohol pricing, and what penalties could the retailer face for non-compliance?","Under the Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018, it is an offence for alcohol retailers in Wales to sell alcohol below the applicable minimum price, regardless of discounts or promotions. The Act defines the minimum price using the formula M × S × V, where M is the minimum unit price (set at 50p), S is the percentage strength of the alcohol, and V is the volume in litres. Non-compliance can result in enforcement actions by local authorities, including the issuance of fixed penalty notices of £200 for each offence. Therefore, retailers must adhere to the minimum pricing regulations, as discounts and promotions do not permit selling alcohol below the established minimum price.","The Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018 stipulates that the minimum unit price for alcohol in Wales is £4.25 per unit (200ml). This means that licensed premises, including retailers and pubs, must not sell alcohol at a price that is lower than this minimum unit price.

If a retailer in Wales is found selling alcohol below the minimum unit price, they could face penalties under the Act. These may include:

1. A fixed penalty notice: The Welsh Government can issue a fixed penalty notice to the retailer for non-compliance.
2. Fines: The court can impose fines of up to £5,000 on the retailer for each day they fail to comply with the minimum unit price requirement.
3. Prosecution: In more serious cases, the retailer may be prosecuted in court, which could result in a fine or even imprisonment (although this is unlikely).
4. Revocation of license: If the retailer is found guilty of repeatedly breaching the minimum unit price requirement, their license to sell alcohol may be revoked.

It's worth noting that the Act also provides for exemptions and relaxations in certain circumstances, such as for licensed premises serving only beer or cider, or for retailers offering discounts for bulk purchases. However, these exemptions are subject to specific conditions and requirements.","['', ' Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018']",25,False,"Small producer relief – certain removals within the United Kingdom

These Regulations provide for a single excise duty system for alcoholic products generally, consolidating and replacing the various systems used for individual alcoholic products. Duty is based on the volume and strength of the finished product. These Regulations also make provision for reliefs from excise duty.
Part 1 of these Regulations provides for citation, commencement and interpretation.
Part 2 provides for a new system for measuring alcoholic strength. Regulations 2 and 3 set out the methods for ascertaining the volume and strength of alcoholic products respectively. Regulation 4 sets out the circumstances in which and the means by which HMRC may carry out assessments where an incorrectly low amount of duty has been applied.
Part 3 makes provision in relation to reliefs from duty. Regulation 5 does so for undrinkable sediment, regulation 6 for grower’s domestic consumption relief and regulation 7 for draught relief. Regulations 8 to 14 do so for small producer relief (specifically as to what constitutes a small producer alcoholic product in Northern Ireland, how payments of duty may be made where products are moved between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, documentation to be provided, and record-keeping.
Part 4, in regulation 15, makes provision in relation to denatured alcohol.
Part 5, in regulation 16, makes provision in relation to travellers’ allowances (specifically in relation to rates).
Schedule 1 provides for the tolerance requirements for large packs filled with metered or weighed volumes of alcoholic product. Schedule 2 provides for the method of determining the strength of alcoholic product where due care has not been taken to ensure that the strength ascertained in accordance with any of the deeming methods set out in regulation 3 accurately represents the actual strength of the alcoholic product.

The modifications provide automatic extensions of premises licences that only permit sales of alcohol for consumption on the premises (“on-sales”) to allow sales of alcohol for consumption off the premises (“off-sales”). They also apply temporary conditions to licences where there is a pre-existing permission for off-sales, to enable those premises to operate in the same ways as those granted the new permission, and provide for off-sales reviews to take place on grounds which are relevant to one or more of the licensing objectives. The licensing objectives are set out in section 4 of the 2003 Act.
Regulation 2 extends the application of the modifications for a period of 18 months, from 30 September 2023 to 31 March 2025. The expiry date was changed to 30 September 2023 from 30 September 2022 by S.I. 2022/978. Prior to that, S.I. 2021/1049 had changed the expiry date to 30 September 2022.
The amendments are made to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.

Wales,"A homeowner in Wales wants to build a large extension to their property without applying for planning permission, arguing that it's within permitted development rights. Under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Wales) Order 1995 and recent amendments, what are the rules regarding extensions, and when is planning permission required?","Under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Wales) Order 1995, as amended, specific conditions allow certain extensions to be built without a formal planning application, known as permitted development rights. Below are the key provisions relevant to the homeowner’s question:\nRelevant Provisions for Extensions:\nVolume Limitations:\n                        * Terraced Houses or Properties on Article 1(5) Land: The cumulative volume of the extension must not exceed the volume of the original dwellinghouse by more than 50 cubic meters or 10% (whichever is greater).\n                        * Other Houses: The cumulative volume must not exceed 70 cubic meters or 15% (whichever is greater).\n                        * Absolute Limit: In all cases, the increase must not exceed 115 cubic meters.\nHeight Restrictions:\n                        * The height of the extension must not exceed the highest part of the existing roof.\n                        * For properties with a flat roof, the extension must not be taller than the height of the original dwellinghouse.\nProximity to Boundaries:\n                        * No part of the extension should be nearer to any highway than the nearest part of the original dwellinghouse unless the extension is at least 20 meters from the highway.\nDesignated Areas:\n                        * Properties in designated areas such as conservation areas, National Parks, or Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty have more restricted permitted development rights, potentially requiring formal planning permission even for smaller extensions.\nImportant Considerations:\n                        * Amendments: The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (Wales) Orders 2014 and 2019 introduce specific changes and clarifications but do not fundamentally alter the provisions related to standard extensions under Schedule 2, Part 1. The 2014 amendment refines some criteria for residential projects, while the 2019 amendment includes updates relevant to designated areas and certain types of land use.\n                        * Verification with Authorities: Due to potential nuances or recent legislative changes that could affect individual cases, consulting the local planning authority or a professional planner is crucial to confirm compliance with current regulations.","Under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Wales) Order 1995 and recent amendments, including regulation 12 of the Developments of National Significance (Wales) Regulations 2016, a homeowner in Wales may be able to build an extension without planning permission if it meets certain conditions. These regulations also amended regulation 11A of the same regulations.

Wales,"A parent in Wales is seeking additional learning support for their child, who has been diagnosed with special educational needs (SEN). How does the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 protect the child’s right to education, and what steps should the parent take to ensure their child receives the necessary support?","The Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 provides a strong legal framework to protect the rights of children with special educational needs (SEN) in Wales, ensuring they receive appropriate education and support. Here's how the Act safeguards these rights and the steps parents should take:\nHow the Act Protects the Child’s Right to Education\n                           * Definition of Additional Learning Needs (ALN) (Section 2): The Act defines ALN as a learning difficulty or disability that requires additional learning provision. This ensures children who face significantly greater learning challenges than their peers or have disabilities affecting their use of educational facilities are identified and supported.\n                           * Individual Development Plans (IDPs) (Section 10): The Act mandates the creation of IDPs for children with ALN. These comprehensive, tailored plans detail the specific support required and are maintained by local authorities or educational institutions, guaranteeing that each child's unique needs are met.\n                           * Duties of Local Authorities and Schools (Sections 11 and 14): Local authorities and the governing bodies of maintained schools have a duty to identify children with ALN and make appropriate provisions. They must review these provisions regularly to ensure their effectiveness and adapt them as needed.\n                           * Participation and Rights (Section 6): The Act emphasizes involving children and their parents in the decision-making process regarding ALN support. Authorities must also consider the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, reinforcing a rights-based approach.\n                           * Access to Information and Advice (Section 9): The Act requires local authorities to provide parents with information and advice on ALN and the available support, empowering them to make informed decisions.\n                           * Dispute Resolution and Appeals (Sections 68 and 70): The Act establishes clear mechanisms for resolving disagreements. If parents are unsatisfied with the IDP or support provided, they can use local dispute resolution services. Additionally, they have the right to appeal decisions to the Education Tribunal for Wales.\nSteps Parents Should Take to Ensure Their Child Receives Support\n                           * Request an Assessment: Parents can request that the local authority assess their child for ALN. Although the Act does not explicitly state this in Section 11, it mandates that authorities and schools must decide if a child has ALN when concerns are raised.\n                           * Engage in the IDP Process: Actively participate in the development and review of the IDP. Ensure the IDP reflects the child's current needs and advocate for revisions as needed.\n                           * Utilize Available Resources: Make use of the information and advice provided by local authorities as mandated in Section 9. This will help parents understand their rights and the provisions their child is entitled to.\n                           * Address Disagreements: If there are concerns about the IDP or the support provided, use the dispute resolution mechanisms outlined in Section 68. For unresolved issues, parents can appeal to the Education Tribunal for Wales as outlined in Section 70.\n                           * Regularly Review the IDP: Ensure that the IDP is reviewed regularly, as mandated by the Act, to keep it aligned with the child’s evolving educational needs.\nThis framework ensures that children with SEN in Wales receive the educational support they require, and parents are empowered to advocate effectively for their child’s rights.","The Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 protects the child's right to education by ensuring that they receive a suitable education that meets their individual needs. The Act requires local authorities to:

1. Assess the child's additional learning needs
2. Develop an education, training, and care plan for the child
3. Provide the child with a suitable education that meets their individual needs

To ensure their child receives the necessary support, a parent in Wales can take the following steps:

1. Request an assessment: The parent should request an assessment to determine the child's additional learning needs.
2. Work with the local authority: The parent should work closely with the local authority to develop an education, training, and care plan that meets the child's individual needs.
3. Appeal if necessary: If the parent is not satisfied with the assessment or the plan, they can appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.
4. Seek support from advocacy services: The parent may want to seek support from advocacy services, such as the Education Support Partnership, which can provide guidance and representation throughout the process.
5. Stay informed: The parent should stay informed about their child's progress and any changes to the education plan.

Overall, the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 provides a framework for ensuring that children with special educational needs receive a suitable education that meets their individual needs. By working closely with the local authority and seeking support from advocacy services, parents can ensure their child receives the necessary support to succeed in school.","['', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 2: Definition of Additional Learning Needs (ALN)\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 6: Participation and Rights\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 9: Access to Information and Advice\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 10: Individual Development Plans (IDPs)\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 11: Duties to Decide: Maintained Schools and Further Education Institutions\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 14: Duties of Local Authorities and Schools\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 68: Dispute Resolution Mechanisms\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 70: Appeals to the Education Tribunal for Wales']",25,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Scotland,"An employee in Scotland has recently lost a child and is unsure of their entitlement to bereavement leave. Under the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018, what are their rights, and what obligations does the employer have?","Under the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018, incorporated into the Employment Rights Act 1996 and the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, employees in Scotland who have lost a child are entitled to specific rights, and employers have corresponding obligations. Section 80EA of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (as amended) grants eligible employees the right to take at least two weeks of parental bereavement leave. This leave must be taken within 56 days from the date of the child’s death and applies to the death of a child under 18. Section 80EE extends these rights to cases involving stillbirths after 24 weeks of pregnancy. Employers are obligated to provide this leave, ensuring that eligible employees can take time off without facing any detriment or dismissal related to their leave request. For statutory parental bereavement pay, Section 171ZZ6 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (as amended) outlines the entitlement, specifying that the employee must meet certain conditions such as a continuous employment period of at least 26 weeks ending with the ""relevant week"" (the week immediately before the child’s death) and minimum earnings meeting the lower earnings limit. Section 171ZZ7 adds that employees must give notice to their employer about the weeks for which they seek parental bereavement pay, and employers may require this notice in writing. Regulations under this section may also stipulate further requirements, such as providing evidence of entitlement or conditions for determining continuous employment. In addition to these primary sections, reviewing supporting regulations linked to the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018 and related guidance is essential for comprehensive compliance. Regulations detail how leave is to be taken, how statutory pay is processed, and additional procedural requirements for both employees and employers.","The parent who has recently lost a child in Scotland is entitled to parental bereavement leave under the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018. The employee's rights include:

* Entitlement to take up to two weeks' paid bereavement leave after the death of their child
* A minimum of one week's pay for each qualifying week of bereavement leave

The employer's obligations include:

* Providing the employee with a minimum of one week's pay for each qualifying week of bereavement leave
* Allowing the employee to take up to two weeks' paid bereavement leave after the death of their child
* Not taking disciplinary action against the employee during their bereavement leave

It is worth noting that the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018 applies to all employees in Scotland, including those who are not entitled to statutory pay. However, if the employer does not have a parental bereavement policy in place, they may be able to negotiate with the employee to provide pay for their leave.","['', ' 1.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations introduce a new statutory entitlement for bereaved parents who are employees to take up to two weeks’ leave from their job called parental bereavement leave in the 56 weeks following the death of a child. These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers inserted into the Employment Rights Act 1996 (c. 18) (the “1996 Act”) by the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay Act) 2018 (c. 24).
Part 2 relates to entitlement to parental bereavement leave. The right to take parental bereavement leave is conferred by regulation 4 which sets out the conditions for entitlement which must be satisfied by the employee in order to take parental bereavement leave. These include substantive requirements, such as the employee falling within the definition of a bereaved parent (in particular, specifying the types of parental relationships in respect of which the new entitlement arises), as well as procedural requirements, such as the employee giving appropriate notices to their employer. Where an employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave under regulation 4 as the result of the death of more than one child, the employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave in respect of each child.
Regulation 5 sets out the number of weeks of parental bereavement leave that are available to a bereaved parent and gives an employee the option of taking either one or two weeks’ parental bereavement leave. The weeks taken as parental bereavement leave do not need to be taken consecutively. It also provides that parental bereavement leave may only be taken within the period of 56 weeks beginning with the date of the child’s death.
Regulation 6 details the notice requirements and other information the bereaved parent must provide to their employer before taking parental bereavement leave. An employee does not need to provide notice in writing to his or her employer, but the length of notice required to book and cancel parental bereavement leave will vary depending on whether the period the employee intends to take as parental bereavement leave falls within 56 days of the child’s death or later. Regulations 7 and 8 respectively set out when an employee’s period of bereavement leave may start and what happens when a period of parental bereavement leave is interrupted by another type of statutory leave under Part 8 of the 1996 Act.
Part 3 contains provisions applicable in relation to the taking of parental bereavement leave. Regulation 9 elaborates on the new section 80EB of the 1996 Act, by providing that an employee is entitled during his or her absence on leave to the benefit of all of his or her terms and conditions of employment apart from the right to remuneration (excluded by Section 80EB(3)(b)); also that the employee is subject to all of the obligations under those terms and conditions except in so far as they are inconsistent with the right to take parental bereavement leave (the exception appears in section 80EB(1)(b)). Regulations 10 and 11 provide for an employee’s right to return to work after taking a period of parental bereavement leave, distinguishing the case where the leave was an isolated period of absence from the case where it followed another period of statutory leave. Regulations 12 and 13 provide that an employee entitled to parental bereavement leave is protected from detriment and dismissal attributable to the fact that they took or sought to take parental bereavement leave.
Part 4 contains provisions applicable where an employee has a contractual right to parental bereavement leave, in addition to the statutory right contained within these Regulations.
These Regulations are part of a package of legislative measures and the relevant impact assessment is the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill impact assessment which was published on 14 May 2018.

These Regulations bring into force the substantive provisions of the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018 (c. 24), including Schedule 1 which introduces a new Chapter 4 (Parental Bereavement Leave) in Part 8 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (c. 18) and a new Part 12ZD (Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay) in the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (c. 4).","{'category': 'May contain legislation that applies to Scotland', 'country': 'Scotland', 'file': 'The Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018 (Commencement) Regulations 2020.txt', 'legislation': 'UK Statutory Instruments', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/45/note/made', 'year': '2020'}","EXPLANATORY NOTE

This created an entitlement to statutory parental bereavement pay in Northern Ireland.

Scotland,"A tenant in Scotland has reported significant dampness and mold in their rented flat to the landlord, who has not taken any action. Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, what are the landlord's obligations, and what steps can the tenant take to enforce these obligations?","Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, landlords are required to ensure that their rental properties meet the Repairing Standard, as defined in Section 13 of the Act. This includes ensuring that the property is wind and watertight, reasonably fit for human habitation, and that the structure and exterior are in a reasonable state of repair. Additionally, installations for the supply of water, gas, electricity, sanitation, heating, and hot water must be kept in proper working order. Significant dampness and mold indicate a failure to meet this standard. Under Section 14, landlords have a duty to ensure that the house meets the repairing standard at the start of the tenancy and throughout its duration. This duty requires landlords to complete any necessary repairs within a reasonable time after being notified by the tenant or otherwise becoming aware of the need for repairs. Failure to act within a reasonable timeframe constitutes a breach of this duty. If the landlord does not take action, the tenant can apply to the First-tier Tribunal under Section 22 of the Act. This section allows tenants to seek a decision from the Tribunal if the property does not meet the Repairing Standard. The Tribunal can investigate and issue a Repairing Standard Enforcement Order (RSEO) under Section 24, compelling the landlord to carry out the required repairs within a specified timeframe. If the landlord fails to comply with the RSEO, under Section 26, the Tribunal must notify the local authority and may consider imposing a rent relief order to reduce the tenant’s rent. The Tribunal may excuse non-compliance if the landlord demonstrates an inability to comply due to a lack of necessary rights (e.g., access) or if the required work poses a danger to any person. In such cases, the Tribunal must notify the local authority of its findings. The Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 provides tenants with clear mechanisms to address substandard housing conditions and enforce their rights against landlords who fail to fulfill their obligations. These regulations govern the procedures of the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland Housing and Property Chamber, which is responsible for handling cases brought under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, including applications related to the Repairing Standard. The regulations ensure that disputes between tenants and landlords are resolved fairly and efficiently. They outline the rules for submitting applications, conducting hearings, issuing decisions, and enforcing orders such as Repairing Standard Enforcement Orders (RSEOs). This procedural framework directly supports tenants in seeking remedies for landlords' failures to meet their legal obligations under the Act.","Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 1988, a landlord is required to:

1. Maintain the property in a habitable condition;
2. Provide a safe and healthy environment for the tenant; and
3. Take reasonable steps to prevent dampness and mold.

Given that the tenant has reported significant dampness and mold in their rented flat and the landlord has not taken any action, the tenant's next steps would be:

1. Write to the landlord: The tenant should write a formal letter to the landlord, reiterating the issues with dampness and mold, and requesting immediate action to address them.
2. Seek mediation: The tenant can contact a local housing association or a tenancy organization for assistance in resolving the issue through mediation.
3. File a complaint: If the landlord fails to respond or take action, the tenant can file a complaint with the Scottish Housing Ombudsman (SHO), which is responsible for investigating complaints about landlords and tenants' rights.
4. Consider court action: If the situation does not improve, the tenant may need to seek court action under the Housing (Scotland) Act 1988 to enforce their rights.

Additionally, the tenant can also contact their local council's housing department or a tenancy organization for guidance and support in resolving the issue.

Note that the question mentions the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, but it is actually the Housing (Scotland) Act 1988 that provides the relevant provisions.","['', ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 13: The Repairing Standard\r\n', "" Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 14: Landlord's Duty to Repair and Maintain\r\n"", ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 22: Application to the First', 'tier Tribunal\r\n', ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 24: Repairing Standard Enforcement Order (RSEO)\r\n', ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 26: Effect of Failure to Comply with Repairing Standard Enforcement Order\r\n', ' Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014\r\n', ' First', 'tier Tribunal for Scotland Housing and Property Chamber (Procedure) Regulations 2017 https://www.legislation.gov.Unitedkingdom/ssi/2017/328/contents/made']",25,False,"Safeguards for landlords: substantial rent arrears and financial hardship

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations introduce measures to improve the energy efficiency of certain private rented property in Scotland.
The Regulations apply to domestic private rented property. They prescribe a minimum level of energy efficiency by means of the energy performance indicator included on the energy performance certificate for the property. This minimum level is set for the period from 1 October 2020 to 31 March 2022 as an energy efficiency or performance rating of E, and for the period from and after 1 April 2022 as an energy efficiency or performance rating of D. The Regulations provide that, subject to prescribed exceptions, a landlord of a domestic private rented property must not grant a new tenancy of the property after 1 October 2020, and must not continue to let the property after that date, where the energy efficiency or performance rating of the property is below the minimum level.
The Regulations make provision for the enforcement of the requirements of the Regulations by local authorities in relation to domestic private rented properties (“enforcement authority”). Landlords seeking to rely on a prescribed exemption when letting a private rented property which falls below the minimum level of energy efficiency must register that exemption on a register maintained by the local authority for their area. Where an enforcement authority considers that a landlord may be in breach of a requirement of the Regulations, it may serve a compliance notice requiring the landlord to provide evidence to the enforcement authority. Where an enforcement authority is satisfied that a landlord is in breach, it may issue a penalty notice imposing a financial penalty. The landlord may request a review of the penalty notice by the enforcement authority and, where a penalty notice is confirmed on review, may appeal against the imposition of the penalty notice to Sheriff court.","{'category': 'Exclusively or primarily applies to Scotland', 'country': 'Scotland', 'file': 'The Energy Efficiency (Domestic Private Rented Property) (Scotland) Regulations 2020.txt', 'legislation': 'Scottish Draft Statutory Instruments', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/sdsi/2020/9780111043912/note', 'year': '2020'}","Pre-action requirements for private residential tenancies

Scotland,"An individual in Scotland is experiencing domestic abuse from their partner with whom they share a tenancy. They wish to remove the abuser from the home but are unsure of their rights. Under the Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021, what legal protections are available, and what steps should they take?","Individuals experiencing domestic abuse in Scotland can seek protection through several legal mechanisms. Under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, they can apply for a Non-Harassment Order, which prohibits the abuser from engaging in threatening or harassing behavior. Additionally, the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981 allows for an Exclusion Order to remove the abuser from the shared home and prevent them from re-entering. This Act applies not only to married couples but also to cohabitants. The individual should contact the police to report the abuse, as domestic abuse is a criminal offense under the Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2018, which recognizes controlling behavior as abuse. Seeking legal advice from a solicitor experienced in domestic abuse cases is advisable to assist with applications for protective orders, and engaging with support services such as Scottish Women's Aid can provide additional assistance and guidance.","Under the Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021, an individual experiencing domestic abuse in Scotland has several legal protections available to them. Here are some of the key provisions:

1. **Emergency Protection Order**: If the individual is at risk of harm, they can apply for an Emergency Protection Order (EPO) from a Sheriff Court or a local authority. This order provides temporary protection for the individual and their children, prohibiting the abuser from entering the home.
2. **Non-Harassing Direct Communication Order**: An individual can also apply for a Non-Harassing Direct Communication Order (NHDCO), which restricts direct communication between the parties to prevent further harm.
3. **Restrictive Orders**: The court may issue Restrictive Orders, which limit contact with the abuser, including restrictions on traveling together or sharing accommodation.

To remove the abuser from the home, the individual can take the following steps:

1. **Contact a domestic abuse support service**: Reach out to a local domestic abuse support service for guidance and support. They will help you assess your situation and provide advice on how to proceed.
2. **Apply for an Emergency Protection Order (EPO)**: If you're at risk of harm, apply for an EPO from a Sheriff Court or a local authority. This order provides temporary protection until the court decides whether to make a non-harassing direct communication order or restrict the abuser's access to you.
3. **Seek advice on Non-Harassing Direct Communication Order (NHDCO)**: If you want to limit direct contact with the abuser, seek advice from a support service or a solicitor on how to apply for an NHDCO.
4. **Contact the police**: If there's an immediate risk of harm, contact the police and report the situation.

It's essential to note that these processes can be complex and time-consuming. It's recommended that you seek guidance from a support service or a solicitor who specializes in domestic abuse law to ensure your rights are protected and the abuser is removed from the home safely.","['', ' Protection from Harassment Act 1997\r\n', ' Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981\r\n', ' Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2018']",25,False,"Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision in connection with the redress scheme established by the Redress for Survivors (Historical Child Abuse in Care) (Scotland) Act 2021 (asp 15) (“the Act”).
Section 18 of the Act enables a person to apply for a redress payment if the person or, in the case of an application for a next of kin payment, the person in respect of whom the application is made was abused while a child, and resident in a relevant care setting in Scotland. The abuse (as defined in section 19 of the Act to include sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse and abuse which takes the form of neglect) must have occurred before 1 December 2004. The definition of “relevant care setting” in section 20 of the Act comprises residential institutions such as children’s homes and residential care facilities, as well as other residential placements in consequence of boarding out or fostering arrangements. Section 18 is subject to section 23 of the Act.
Section 23(1) of the Act enables the Scottish Ministers to make regulations providing that an application may not be made under section 18 if the person who carried out the abuse was of a specified description, if the abuse was carried out in circumstances of a specified description, if the person who was abused came to be resident in the relevant care setting concerned in specified circumstances, or if the person who was abused was resident in the relevant care setting concerned for a specified purpose.
These Regulations make provision under section 23 of the Act for the purpose of creating exceptions to eligibility to apply for a redress payment under section 18 of the Act.
Regulation 2 makes provision for an exception where a person was placed in a relevant care setting for the purpose of being provided with short-term respite or holiday under arrangements made between a parent or guardian of that person and another person.
Impact assessments have been prepared in relation to the Act and instruments under it and will be published online at www.gov.scot.","{'category': 'Exclusively or primarily applies to Scotland', 'country': 'Scotland', 'file': 'The Redress for Survivors (Historical Child Abuse in Care) (Exceptions to Eligibility) (Scotland) Regulations 2021.txt', 'legislation': 'Scottish Statutory Instruments', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2021/413/note/made', 'year': '2021'}","EXPLANATORY NOTE

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Sections 65 and 66 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 (c. 17) introduce new Part 4A into the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 and new Part 7A into the Courts Act 2003, respectively. Those provisions operate in family and civil proceedings to prohibit cross-examination in person between a party and a witness in defined circumstances, including where there is evidence of domestic abuse between them. The prohibition will apply automatically where there has been a conviction, charge (applicable in family proceedings only) or caution for a specified offence, where an on-notice protective injunction is in force between the party and witness or where there is other specified evidence of domestic abuse.
These Regulations specify the types of offences, protective injunctions and forms of evidence which will trigger the automatic prohibition of cross-examination in person between the party and witness.
Regulation 2 introduces Schedule 1 to the Regulations which contains a list of the specified offences, under the law of England and Wales (table 1), Scotland (table 2) and Northern Ireland (table 3).
Regulation 3 introduces Schedule 2 to the Regulations which contains a list of the specified protective injunctions, orders and interdicts under the law of England and Wales (table 1), Scotland (table 2) and Northern Ireland (table 3).
Regulation 4(1) introduces Schedule 3 to the Regulations which contains a list of the forms of evidence of domestic abuse which are specified. Regulation 4(2) requires that the evidence show that there has been domestic abuse between the party and the witness.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.","{'category': 'May contain legislation that applies to Scotland', 'country': 'Scotland', 'file': 'The Prohibition of Cross-Examination in Person (Civil and Family Proceedings) Regulations 2022.txt', 'legislation': 'UK Statutory Instruments', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2022/568/note/made', 'year': '2022'}"
Scotland,"A retailer in Scotland is considering selling alcohol below the minimum unit price due to competitive pressures. They want to know the legal implications. Under the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012, what are the retailer's obligations, and what penalties could they face for non-compliance? ","Under the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012, which amends the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, retailers in Scotland are required to sell alcohol at or above a minimum unit price (MPU) set by the Scottish Ministers. This rule applies to all licensed premises, including shops, bars, restaurants, and temporary events with occasional licenses. The minimum price condition is detailed in Schedule 3, Paragraph 6A for premises licenses and Schedule 4, Paragraph 5A for occasional licenses. Alcohol must be sold at a minimum price calculated by multiplying the MPU by the strength and volume of the alcohol. As amended by The Alcohol (Minimum Price per Unit) (Scotland) Order 2018, the current MPU is set at 65 pence per unit. Retailers must comply with this minimum price, and selling alcohol below this threshold constitutes a breach of licensing conditions. If a retailer fails to meet the minimum pricing requirement, Section 36 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 allows the licensing board to review the premises license and impose penalties as needed. Following a review, the board may suspend the license temporarily, revoke the license entirely, or modify the license conditions to enforce compliance. These penalties aim to uphold public health and ensure responsible alcohol sales.","Under the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012, retailers in Scotland are obligated to sell alcohol at a minimum unit price (MUP) of £4.25 per liter for beer, wine, and spirits above 8% ABV. This law aims to reduce problem drinking and related social problems.

If a retailer fails to comply with the MUP, they may face penalties, including:

1. Fines: The Scottish Government can impose fines on retailers who sell alcohol below the MUP.
2. Enforcement notices: Trading Standards officers or other authorized officials can issue enforcement notices requiring the retailer to take immediate action to bring their stock into compliance.
3. Court action: In severe cases, the Crown can seek a court order to stop the sale of prohibited alcohol and recover any losses incurred by the authority.

To avoid these penalties, retailers must:

1. Ensure that all alcoholic products sold in Scotland are above the MUP.
2. Keep accurate records of sales and stock levels to demonstrate compliance.
3. Provide information and assistance to customers who may be struggling with their drinking habits.

Retailers who sell alcohol below the MUP risk not only fines but also reputational damage, loss of business, and potential prosecution. It is essential for retailers to stay informed about the law and take steps to ensure they are compliant with the minimum unit pricing regulations.","['', ' Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, Schedule 3, Paragraph 6A ', ' Premises Licence Mandatory Conditions\r\n', ' Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, Schedule 4, Paragraph 5A ', ' Occasional Licence Mandatory Conditions\r\n', ' The Alcohol (Minimum Price per Unit) (Scotland) Order 2018 ', ' Minimum Unit Pricing for Alcohol in Scotland\r\n', ' Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, Section 36 ', ' Application for Review of Premises Licence:']",25,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Scotland,"A parent in Scotland believes their child requires additional support in school due to a learning difficulty. Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 (as amended), what rights does the child have, and what steps can the parent take to secure the necessary support?","Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004, as amended, children in Scotland who require additional support due to learning difficulties are legally entitled to specific rights. Education authorities have a duty to assess and provide for these needs when required. According to Section 8(1), if a parent requests an assessment to determine whether their child has additional support needs or requires a Co-ordinated Support Plan (CSP), the education authority must comply with this request unless it is deemed unreasonable. Following assessment, Section 4(1)(a) requires the education authority to make adequate and efficient provision for the identified needs, which can include specialized resources or tailored teaching approaches. If a child’s support needs involve multiple agencies, such as social work or healthcare in addition to education, Section 9(1) ensures they are entitled to a CSP, a document outlining coordinated support across agencies. Parents also have the right, under Section 12(2), to be actively involved in developing and reviewing support plans to ensure that their child’s educational requirements are fully understood and addressed. If disagreements arise regarding the support provided or decisions made, Section 18(1) grants parents the right to appeal to the Additional Support Needs Tribunal for Scotland, which can make binding rulings on disputes related to additional support. These legislative provisions provide a strong framework for ensuring children’s educational needs are met and give parents a clear process to advocate for the support their child requires.","Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 (as amended), a child with a learning difficulty has several rights that entitle them to additional support in school. These rights include:

1. The right to receive special educational needs provision: This includes access to special educational needs coordinator (SENCO), teacher guidance, and resource allocation.
2. The right to an Education Plan: An education plan outlines the child's strengths, weaknesses, and learning difficulties, as well as the support that will be provided in school.
3. The right to regular reviews of their education plan: This ensures that the support is tailored to meet the child's changing needs.

To secure additional support for the child, the parent can take the following steps:

1. Request a meeting with the SENCO or Headteacher to discuss the child's needs and provide evidence of the learning difficulty.
2. Obtain an Education Plan that outlines the support to be provided in school.
3. Attend regular reviews of the education plan to ensure that it remains tailored to meet the child's changing needs.
4. Ensure that the school follows the Child at Home guidance, which sets out procedures for supporting children with additional support needs when they are away from school.
5. Request an independent review of the education plan if necessary.

Additionally, parents can also seek assistance from organizations such as the Children and Young People's Learning Disability Partnership (CYP-LDP) or the Scottish Association for Mental Health (SAMH), which provide guidance and support on supporting children with additional support needs in school.

It is also recommended to consult with a solicitor who specializes in education law, as they can provide advice on the child's rights and the best course of action to secure the necessary support.",['Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004'],25,False,"Provision of advocacy services

the Advice and Assistance (Assistance by Way of Representation) (Scotland) Regulations 2003 (“the 2003 Regulations”), and
the Children’s Legal Assistance (Scotland) Regulations 2013 (“the 2013 Regulations”).
Regulation 2 amends section 28C of the 1986 Act to make children’s legal aid automatically available to a child in relation to whom an application is made for any of the orders under Part 4 of the 2019 Act. Legal aid is made available for representations by the child when a sheriff is considering an application for an order, as well as for applying for permission to appeal the subsequent decision and for any resultant appeal proceedings.
Regulation 2 also makes consequential amendments to section 41 of the 1986 Act (interpretation), adding a definition of the 2019 Act and amending the definition of children’s legal assistance to include proceedings under Part 4 of the 2019 Act.
Regulation 3 amends schedule 7 of the 1989 Regulations to provide that fees for proceedings under Part 4 of the 2019 Act, other than children’s legal aid provided automatically under section 28C of the Legal Aid (to which regulation 2 of these Regulations relates), are payable under schedule 5 of the 1989 Regulations.
Regulation 4 amends regulation 3 of the 1993 Regulations to provide that the financial limit applicable to advice by way of representation provided in relation to proceedings under Part 4 of the 2019 Act is £500.
Regulation 5 amends the definition of “child” in regulation 2 of the 1996 Regulations (interpretation) to include the different meaning that applies in proceedings under Chapter 3 of Part 4 of the 2019 Act. For the purposes of the other proceedings under the 2019 Act, the meaning of “child” is included in the current definition in regulation 2 of the 1996 Regulations.
Regulation 5 also amends part 1 of schedule 3 of the 1996 Regulations to provide that the fees allowable to solicitors for providing assistance by way of representation in relation to proceedings under Part 4 of the 2019 Act are those set out in the table of fees in that part.
Regulation 6 amends regulation 3A of the 2003 Regulations, which includes provision for assistance by way of representation in relation to section 28C of the 1986 Act. As a result of the amendments made by regulation 2 of these Regulations, regulation 3A applies to proceedings under Part 4 of the 2019 Act.

regulation 7(2) amends regulation 2 (interpretation) to add definitions of “child”, “interested person” and “parent” in respect of proceedings under part 4 of the 2019 Act,
regulation 7(3) amends regulation 5 (children’s legal aid: individual) to provide for children’s legal aid for an individual who is a parent or interested person in respect of proceedings under Part 4 of the 2019 Act, subject to the means test in paragraph (2)(c) of that regulation,
regulation 7(4) amends regulation 6 (distinct proceedings) to provide that proceedings relating to an application for any of the orders under Part 4 of the 2019 Act, permission to appeal a decision made in respect of such an application, and where permission is granted the appeal of that decision itself are to be treated as a single set of proceedings for the purposes of children’s legal aid,
regulation 7(5) amends regulation 18 (matters of special urgency) to provide that, if it appears to the Scottish Legal Aid Board that it is reasonable in the particular circumstances of the case, it may make children’s legal aid available where an application is made by a parent or interested person in relation to proceedings under Part 4 of the 2019 Act and any of the steps specified has required to be taken as a matter of special urgency to protect the applicant’s position.

NothernIreland,"An individual in NothernIreland is experiencing domestic abuse and seeks protection from their abuser. Under the Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (NothernIreland) 2021, what legal protections are available, and what steps should they take to secure those protections?","An individual in NothernIreland experiencing domestic abuse is protected under the Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (NothernIreland) 2021. Specifically, Section 1 of the Act criminalizes a course of abusive behaviour towards a person to whom the abuser is personally connected, such as a partner, ex-partner, or family member. The individual should report the abuse to the Police Service of NothernIreland to initiate a criminal investigation under this Act. Section 2 defines ""abusive behaviour"" as behaviour that is violent or threatening, or behaviour where a reasonable person would consider the course of behaviour likely to cause one or more of the following effects on the victim (B):
                                       * Making B dependent on, or subordinate to, A (the abuser);
                                       * Isolating B from friends, relatives, or other sources of social interaction or support;
                                       * Controlling, regulating, or monitoring B's day-to-day activities;
                                       * Depriving B of, or restricting, freedom of action;
                                       * Frightening, humiliating, degrading, or punishing B.
While the Act does not provide specific protective orders, the individual may apply for a Non-Molestation Order or an Occupation Order under the Family Homes and Domestic Violence (NothernIreland) Order 1998. A Non-Molestation Order can prohibit the abuser from molesting the applicant or a relevant child, and an Occupation Order can regulate the occupation of the shared residence. Additionally, Sections 25 to 28 of the Act offer special measures in civil proceedings to support victims, such as prohibiting the abuser from cross-examining the victim in person.
To secure these protections, the individual should:
                                       1. Report the abuse to the Police Service of NothernIreland to initiate criminal proceedings under the Act.
                                       2. Seek legal advice to apply for a Non-Molestation Order or an Occupation Order through the courts.
                                       3. Utilize the special measures provided in the Act during any civil proceedings to ensure their safety and well-being.","In Northern Ireland, an individual experiencing domestic abuse can seek protection under the Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (Northern Ireland) 2021. The legal protections available include:

1. Non-Molestation Order: This order prohibits the abuser from approaching, contacting, or making any form of communication with the victim.
2. Occupation Order: This order requires the abuser to vacate the family home or specific address where the victim resides.
3. Restraining Order: This order restricts the abuser's behavior and activities, such as visiting the victim at work or school.

To secure these protections, an individual can take the following steps:

1. Contact the local police service (PSNI) or a domestic violence helpline (e.g., NI Domestic Abuse Helpline) to report the abuse and request protection.
2. Apply for a Non-Molestation Order, Occupation Order, or Restraining Order through the courts. This typically involves filling out an application form, providing evidence of the abuse, and attending a court hearing.
3. Provide documentation supporting the claim, such as police statements, medical records, and witness statements.
4. Attend the court hearing to provide testimony about the abuse and request the protection orders.
5. Once the order is granted, the abuser must comply with its terms, and the victim can take action if they fail to do so.

It's essential for individuals experiencing domestic abuse to prioritize their safety and seek help as soon as possible. The Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (Northern Ireland) 2021 provides a framework for protection, but it is crucial to act quickly and seek support from trusted authorities or organizations specializing in domestic violence.

Some recommended resources for seeking help and support include:

* NI Domestic Abuse Helpline: 0808 800 9887
* PSNI Domestic Abuse Support Line: 101 (or 111 for non-emergency situations)
* Northern Ireland Women's Coalition (NIWC): [www.niwc.org.uk](http://www.niwc.org.uk)","['', ' Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (NothernIreland) 2021\r\n', ' Family Homes and Domestic Violence (NothernIreland) Order 1998']",25,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

(This note is not part of the Rules)
These Rules amend the Family Procedure Rules 2010 (“the FPR”) (S.I. 2010/2955).
Rules 3 to 6 insert provisions into Part 3A of the FPR as required by section 63 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 (c. 17). The amendments automatically deem victims of domestic abuse as “vulnerable” for the purposes of determining whether a participation direction should be made. The court will therefore not need to make a determination as to vulnerability for parties or witnesses who state that they are, or are at risk of being, victims of domestic abuse before proceeding to consider which measures (if any) are necessary as a result of that vulnerability. The amendments also insert relevant statutory definitions from the Domestic Abuse Act 2021.
Rules 7 and 8 amend Part 10 of the FPR to clarify that the court may direct a means of service, other than personal service, of an application or order under Part 4 of the Family Law Act 1996 (c. 27).
Rule 9 amends rule 10.10 of the FPR to clarify that the court officer must notify the police of certain orders made under Part 4 of the Family Law Act 1996 where the court is to effect service of such an order in accordance with rule 10.6(2) of the FPR.
Rule 10 amends rule 27.11 of the FPR to make provision for the attendance at private hearings by duly authorised lawyers attending for specified purposes.
Rule 11 amends rule 29.6 of the FPR to refer to additional proceedings concerning gender recognition in relation to which documents, while in the custody of the court, must be kept in a place of special security.","{'category': 'May contain legislation that applies to NothernIreland', 'country': 'NothernIreland', 'file': 'The Family Procedure (Amendment No. 2) Rules 2021.txt', 'legislation': 'UK Statutory Instruments', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/875/note/made', 'year': '2021'}","EXPLANATORY NOTE

Sections 65 and 66 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 (c. 17) introduce new Part 4A into the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 and new Part 7A into the Courts Act 2003, respectively. Those provisions operate in family and civil proceedings to prohibit cross-examination in person between a party and a witness in defined circumstances, including where there is evidence of domestic abuse between them. The prohibition will apply automatically where there has been a conviction, charge (applicable in family proceedings only) or caution for a specified offence, where an on-notice protective injunction is in force between the party and witness or where there is other specified evidence of domestic abuse.
These Regulations specify the types of offences, protective injunctions and forms of evidence which will trigger the automatic prohibition of cross-examination in person between the party and witness.
Regulation 2 introduces Schedule 1 to the Regulations which contains a list of the specified offences, under the law of England and Wales (table 1), Scotland (table 2) and Northern Ireland (table 3).
Regulation 3 introduces Schedule 2 to the Regulations which contains a list of the specified protective injunctions, orders and interdicts under the law of England and Wales (table 1), Scotland (table 2) and Northern Ireland (table 3).

NothernIreland,"An employee in NothernIreland suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage. Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015, what are their rights, and what steps can they take to address the issue?","Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015, an employee in NothernIreland who suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage (NMW) has specific rights and actionable steps to address the issue. The Act mandates that employees must be paid at least the NMW, as set out in Section 1(1), which establishes the legal entitlement to minimum wage for all qualifying workers. Employers are legally required to keep accurate records of wage payments under Section 9 of the Act. These records should be sufficient to demonstrate that an employee is being paid at least the NMW. Therefore, the first step for the employee is to review their pay records to confirm any potential underpayment. Should there be a discrepancy, Section 10 grants the employee the right to formally request access to these records, enabling them to verify their calculations against the NMW requirement. If the employee identifies an underpayment, they should raise this issue with their employer, as it may be an oversight. If the employer fails to resolve the issue, the employee can escalate the matter to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the body responsible for enforcing compliance. While Section 13 of the Act authorizes the Secretary of State to appoint officers for enforcement purposes, Section 14 provides HMRC officers with the power to issue enforcement notices if employers are found non-compliant.  While the Act provides the primary framework, the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015 offer additional details for specific situations, such as valuing accommodation benefits or adjusting for absences, which can influence wage calculations. For most straightforward underpayment cases, the Act alone provides the necessary rights and procedures, with the Regulations supporting only in specific circumstances affecting wage calculation. In addition to these provisions, the Employment Rights (NothernIreland) Order 1996 is also relevant as it grants the employee a procedural framework for seeking redress if they are not compensated as per the NMW. Under the 1996 Order, if an employee experiences a sustained issue with underpayment, they have the right to file a claim with an Industrial Tribunal. This Order, though not specifically addressing minimum wage rates, is essential for the employee’s right to fair wages, as it permits claims for unlawful deduction of wages or breach of contract, allowing the employee to recover underpaid amounts. The 1996 Order thus complements the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 by establishing legal recourse in cases of wage disputes.","Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015, an employee in NothernIreland who suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage has the following rights:

1. Right to minimum wage: The employee is entitled to be paid at least the National Minimum Wage for their work.
2. Right to complaint procedure: The employee has the right to complain to Acas (the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service) or to their employer about any suspected underpayment.

To address the issue, the employee can take the following steps:

1. Keep records: The employee should keep a record of their pay, including dates, amounts, and payment methods.
2. Check pay statements: The employee should check their pay statements to ensure they are being paid correctly.
3. Report suspected underpayment: If the employee suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage, they should report it to Acas or their employer immediately.
4. Seek advice: The employee can seek advice from Acas, a trade union representative, or an employment law solicitor.
5. Consider filing a claim: If the employee believes they have been underpaid, they may be able to file a claim with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) for repayment of the underpaid amount.

It's essential for employees to act promptly and follow the correct procedures to protect their rights and potentially recover any underpaid amounts.","['', ' National Minimum Wage Act 1998\r\n', ' National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015\r\n', ' The Employment Rights (NothernIreland) Order 1996']",25,False,"2.

(a)
the worker resides in the family home of the worker’s employer;
(b)
the worker is not a member of that family, but is treated as such, in particular as regards to the provision of living accommodation and meals and the sharing of tasks and leisure activities;

The requirements in regulation 57(2) are all of the following: the worker is a member of the employer’s family; the worker resides in the family home of the employer; the worker shares in the tasks and activities of the family.
Upon commencement of this instrument, any work which meets the requirements set out in paragraph (3) will be included as “work” for the purposes of the 2015 Regulations. This will mean that from 1st April 2024 a worker must be remunerated in respect of any such work in a pay reference period (as defined by regulation 6 of the 2015 Regulations) at a rate which is not less than the national minimum wage (as set out in Part 2 of the 2015 Regulations).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

NothernIreland,"An employee in NothernIreland has recently lost a child and is unsure about their entitlement to bereavement leave and pay. Under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022, what are their rights, and how can they access them?","Under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022, an employee in NothernIreland who has recently lost a child is entitled to bereavement leave, and if they meet certain criteria, they may also be eligible for bereavement pay. Article 112EA(1)-(3) defines a ""bereaved parent"" as an employee who meets specified relationship conditions with the deceased child, which may include a caregiving role before the child’s death. Employees who lose a child under 18, or experience a stillbirth after 24 weeks of pregnancy, are entitled to at least two weeks of bereavement leave under Article 112EA(5). This leave can be taken either as a single two-week block or in two separate one-week periods. According to Article 112EA(6), this leave must be taken within at least 56 days (eight weeks) from the date of the child’s death, providing flexibility within that period.
If an employee loses more than one child, Article 112EA(7) entitles them to bereavement leave for each child. Article 112EB outlines rights during and after bereavement leave, specifying that employees on leave retain most employment terms and conditions (excluding remuneration). According to Article 112EB(1)(a)-(c), employees are entitled to return to their original or an equivalent job after bereavement leave. Furthermore, Article 112EB(3) provides that if bereavement leave coincides with other types of parental leave (such as maternity or paternity leave), the right to return applies across the entire period of absence.
To access bereavement leave, Article 112ED(a) requires employees to notify their employer as soon as reasonably practicable, specifying the intended dates for leave. Employers are obligated to grant this leave and cannot delay or refuse it. If the employee is also eligible for statutory bereavement pay, they must provide notice and any required documentation as directed under Articles 112ED(a) and (c).","Under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022, an employee in NothernIreland who has recently lost a child is entitled to:

1. **Statutory parental bereavement leave**: The employee is entitled to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave after the loss of their child, with the option to take part or all of this leave as paid holiday.
2. **Statutory parental bereavement pay**: The employee may be eligible for Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay (SPB) while on statutory parental bereavement leave. SPB is a taxable benefit that replaces an employee's normal earnings, and it is calculated based on the employee's usual hours of work and rate of pay.
3. **Employer's obligations**: The employer must provide the employee with information about their entitlement to SPB, including details of the payment and the reason for any non-payment.

To access their rights, the employee should:

1. **Check their contract**: Review their employment contract to see if it includes provisions related to parental bereavement leave and pay.
2. **Contact HR or management**: Reach out to their HR department or line manager to discuss their entitlement to SPB and any necessary procedures for taking statutory parental bereavement leave.
3. **Seek guidance from a representative body**: Contact organizations such as the NothernIreland Social Security Agency, Acas (the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service), or the Trade Union Congress (TUC) for guidance on their rights and entitlements.

The employee can also visit the website of the relevant government department or agency to access information on statutory parental bereavement leave and pay in NothernIreland.","['', ' Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022']",25,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers inserted into the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 (N.I. 16) (the “1996 Order”) by the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 (c. 5).
The Regulations revoke and re-enact the provisions of the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023 which would otherwise cease to have effect by virtue of Article 251(1A) of the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996.
These Regulations provide for a statutory entitlement for bereaved parents who are employees to take up to two weeks’ leave from their job called parental bereavement leave in the 56 weeks following the death of a child.
Part 2 relates to entitlement to parental bereavement leave. The right to take parental bereavement leave is conferred by regulation 4 which sets out the conditions for entitlement which must be satisfied by the employee in order to take parental bereavement leave. These include substantive requirements, such as the employee falling within the definition of a bereaved parent (in particular, specifying the types of parental relationships in respect of which the new entitlement arises), as well as procedural requirements, such as the employee giving appropriate notices to their employer. Where an employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave under regulation 4 as the result of the death of more than one child, the employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave in respect of each child.
Regulation 5 sets out the number of weeks of parental bereavement leave that are available to a bereaved parent and gives an employee the option of taking either one or two weeks’ parental bereavement leave. The weeks taken as parental bereavement leave do not need to be taken consecutively. It also provides that parental bereavement leave may only be taken within the period of 56 weeks beginning with the date of the child’s death.
Regulation 6 details the notice requirements and other information the bereaved parent must provide to their employer before taking parental bereavement leave. An employee does not need to provide notice in writing to his or her employer, but the length of notice required to book and cancel parental bereavement leave will vary depending on whether the period the employee intends to take as parental bereavement leave falls within 56 days of the child’s death or later. Regulations 7 and 8 respectively set out when an employee’s period of bereavement leave may start and what happens when a period of parental bereavement leave is interrupted by another type of statutory leave under Part 9 of the 1996 Order.
Part 3 contains provisions applicable in relation to the taking of parental bereavement leave. Regulation 9 elaborates on the new Article 112EB of the 1996 Order, by providing that an employee is entitled during his or her absence on leave to the benefit of all of his or her terms and conditions of employment apart from the right to remuneration (excluded by Article 112EB(2)(b)); also that the employee is subject to all of the obligations under those terms and conditions except in so far as they are inconsistent with the right to take parental bereavement leave (the exception appears in Article 112EB(1)(b)). Regulations 10 and 11 provide for an employee’s right to return to work after taking a period of parental bereavement leave, distinguishing the case where the leave was an isolated period of absence from the case where it followed another period of statutory leave. Regulations 12 and 13 provide that an employee entitled to parental bereavement leave is protected from detriment and dismissal attributable to the fact that they took or sought to take parental bereavement leave.
Part 4 contains provisions applicable where an employee has a contractual right to parental bereavement leave, in addition to the statutory right contained within these Regulations.
Part 5 (regulations 16 to 22) contains provisions in respect of the Transitional arrangements that will ensure a continuity of entitlement between the revoked Regulations and current Regulations. This part also contains the revocation of the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023.
A separate impact assessment has not been prepared for these Regulations. The Regulations are part of a package of legislative measures and the relevant impact assessment is the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill impact assessment which was published in April 2020.

9.—(1) An employee who takes parental bereavement leave, is, during any period of leave—

(b)
bound by any obligations arising under those terms and conditions, subject only to the exception in Article 112EB(1)(b) of the 1996 Order(1).
(2) In paragraph (1)(a), “terms and conditions of employment” has the meaning given by Article 112EB(2) of the 1996 Order, and accordingly does not include terms and conditions about remuneration.
(3) For the purposes of Article 112EB of the 1996 Order, only sums payable to an employee by way of wages or salary are to be treated as remuneration.
(4) In the case of accrual of rights under an employment-related benefit scheme within the meaning given by paragraph 7 of Schedule 5 to the Social Security (Northern Ireland) Order 1989(2), nothing in paragraph (1)(a) imposes a requirement which exceeds the requirements of paragraph 5D(3) of that Schedule.

the employee may not exercise the statutory right and the corresponding right separately but may, in taking the leave for which the two rights provide, take advantage of whichever right is, in any particular respect, the more favourable; and
(b)
the provisions of the 1996 Order and of these Regulations relating to the statutory right apply, subject to any modifications necessary to give effect to any more favourable contractual terms, to the exercise of the composite right described in sub-paragraph (a) as they apply to the exercise of the statutory right.

Section 2 of the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 (c. 5) (“the 2022 Act”) inserted a new Part 12ZD into the Social Security Contributions and Benefits (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 (c. 7). This created an entitlement to statutory parental bereavement pay in Northern Ireland.
These Regulations make consequential amendments to the Income Tax (Construction Industry Scheme) Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/2045) to include reference to statutory parental bereavement pay payable in Northern Ireland to bring Northern Ireland in line with Great Britain.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations introduce a new statutory entitlement for bereaved parents who are employees to take up to two weeks’ leave from their job called parental bereavement leave in the 56 weeks following the death of a child. These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers inserted into the Employment Rights Act 1996 (c. 18) (the “1996 Act”) by the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay Act) 2018 (c. 24).
Part 2 relates to entitlement to parental bereavement leave. The right to take parental bereavement leave is conferred by regulation 4 which sets out the conditions for entitlement which must be satisfied by the employee in order to take parental bereavement leave. These include substantive requirements, such as the employee falling within the definition of a bereaved parent (in particular, specifying the types of parental relationships in respect of which the new entitlement arises), as well as procedural requirements, such as the employee giving appropriate notices to their employer. Where an employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave under regulation 4 as the result of the death of more than one child, the employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave in respect of each child.
Regulation 5 sets out the number of weeks of parental bereavement leave that are available to a bereaved parent and gives an employee the option of taking either one or two weeks’ parental bereavement leave. The weeks taken as parental bereavement leave do not need to be taken consecutively. It also provides that parental bereavement leave may only be taken within the period of 56 weeks beginning with the date of the child’s death.
Regulation 6 details the notice requirements and other information the bereaved parent must provide to their employer before taking parental bereavement leave. An employee does not need to provide notice in writing to his or her employer, but the length of notice required to book and cancel parental bereavement leave will vary depending on whether the period the employee intends to take as parental bereavement leave falls within 56 days of the child’s death or later. Regulations 7 and 8 respectively set out when an employee’s period of bereavement leave may start and what happens when a period of parental bereavement leave is interrupted by another type of statutory leave under Part 8 of the 1996 Act.
Part 3 contains provisions applicable in relation to the taking of parental bereavement leave. Regulation 9 elaborates on the new section 80EB of the 1996 Act, by providing that an employee is entitled during his or her absence on leave to the benefit of all of his or her terms and conditions of employment apart from the right to remuneration (excluded by Section 80EB(3)(b)); also that the employee is subject to all of the obligations under those terms and conditions except in so far as they are inconsistent with the right to take parental bereavement leave (the exception appears in section 80EB(1)(b)). Regulations 10 and 11 provide for an employee’s right to return to work after taking a period of parental bereavement leave, distinguishing the case where the leave was an isolated period of absence from the case where it followed another period of statutory leave. Regulations 12 and 13 provide that an employee entitled to parental bereavement leave is protected from detriment and dismissal attributable to the fact that they took or sought to take parental bereavement leave.
Part 4 contains provisions applicable where an employee has a contractual right to parental bereavement leave, in addition to the statutory right contained within these Regulations.

NothernIreland,"A tenant in NothernIreland has been served an eviction notice by their landlord, giving them four weeks to vacate the property. The tenant has lived there for two years under a periodic tenancy. Under the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, is the notice period valid, and what rights does the tenant have?","Under the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, a landlord’s notice to quit a property must meet specific statutory notice periods based on the length of the tenancy. This Act amends the Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006, particularly Article 14, to reflect updated notice requirements. For a tenant who has lived in the property for two years under a periodic tenancy, Section 11 of the 2022 Act amends Article 14 of the 2006 Order to specify that the landlord must provide at least 4 months’ notice before requiring the tenant to vacate. This 4-month period applies to tenancies that have existed for more than 12 months but not more than 3 years (as outlined in the new Article 14(1A)(b)). Because the landlord provided only four weeks’ notice, this does not satisfy the legal requirement, rendering the notice invalid. The tenant has the right to remain in the property until a valid notice to quit is served that meets the legally required notice period. Under Section 11 of the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, which amends Article 14 of the Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006, landlords are required to give a minimum 4-month notice for tenancies that have lasted more than 12 months but not more than 3 years. Because the tenant has lived in the property for two years, the landlord’s four-week notice does not meet this requirement and is therefore invalid. The tenant may choose to inform the landlord in writing that the notice is invalid due to the insufficient notice period, referencing Article 14(1), which states that a notice to quit is only valid if it complies with the minimum notice periods required by law. If the landlord proceeds with eviction attempts despite the invalid notice, the tenant may seek legal remedies. While specific injunctions or protections against harassment are not outlined within this tenancy legislation, the tenant may still seek legal assistance through broader NothernIreland housing or civil law protections to prevent an unlawful eviction and maintain peaceful possession of the property.","Based on the information provided, it appears that the tenant in NothernIreland has been served an eviction notice by their landlord. However, I cannot find any specific details about the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022 or its provisions.

In general, under the law of private tenancy, the length of a valid notice period depends on the type of tenancy agreement and whether it is a fixed-term tenancy or a periodic tenancy. Since the tenant has lived in the property for two years under a periodic tenancy, I would expect that the notice period is subject to specific requirements.

Here are some possible rights the tenant may have:

1. **Notice Period**: As per the Private Tenancies (Scotland) Act 2018 (and potentially its NothernIreland equivalent), if the landlord gives a tenant less than six months' written notice, they must provide additional information explaining why the tenancy is being terminated.
2. **Reasons for Eviction**: The tenant has the right to know the specific reasons given by the landlord for serving the eviction notice.
3. **Notice in Writing**: As per standard law of private tenancies, all notices should be in writing and delivered to the tenant's last known address.
4. **Extension of Notice Period**: Depending on the jurisdiction, a tenant might have the right to request an extension of the notice period if they can provide evidence that serving the notice would cause them significant hardship or distress.
5. **Support Services**: The tenant may be entitled to support services such as temporary accommodation, financial assistance, and guidance from local authorities or housing agencies.

To determine the validity of the notice period and the tenant's rights in this specific situation, I recommend consulting with a qualified lawyer specializing in NothernIreland law or seeking advice from a relevant government agency.","['', ' Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022 ', ' Section 11\r\n', ' Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006 ', ' Article 14']",25,False,"Notice to quit: private tenancies

That Act was first amended by the Private Tenancies (Coronavirus Modifications) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2020 (S.R. 2020 No. 192) to extend the emergency period to 31st March 2021 and it was subsequently amended by the Private Tenancies (Coronavirus Modifications) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021 (S.R. 2021 No.41) to further extend the emergency period to 30th September 2021.
These Regulations are made in response to the continuing threat to public health which is posed by the incidence and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) in Northern Ireland and in consideration of the rates of transmission increasing since the beginning of July 2020. As many of the economic support packages such as the Furlough scheme are due to wind down in the autumn, there is potential for a rise in unemployment which may impact private renters’ income streams and place them at increased risk of losing their homes.
These Regulations protect tenants from eviction for a reasonable and specified period of time and provide that landlords must give their tenants at least 12 weeks’ notice to quit a dwelling house let under a private tenancy.","{'category': 'Exclusively or primarily applies to NothernIreland', 'country': 'NothernIreland', 'file': 'The Private Tenancies (Coronavirus Modifications) (No.2) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021.txt', 'legislation': 'Northern Ireland Statutory Rules', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/2021/242/note/made', 'year': '2021'}","EXPLANATORY NOTE

NothernIreland,"An individual in NothernIreland is being harassed and stalked by an ex-partner, causing them significant distress. Under the Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022, what legal protections are available to them, and what steps should they take to ensure their safety?","Under the Protection from Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022, individuals in NothernIreland who are being harassed and stalked by an ex-partner can rely on specific legal protections. The Act clearly defines stalking as a criminal offense in Section 1, where engaging in a course of conduct causing another person to experience fear, alarm, or substantial distress constitutes stalking. Such conduct includes following, contacting, monitoring usage of electronic communications, and other invasive behaviors. Offenders can face severe penalties, with up to 10 years imprisonment or a fine upon conviction on indictment, or up to 12 months imprisonment or a statutory maximum fine upon summary conviction. Additionally, the Act allows for Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs), detailed in Section 7, which the Chief Constable can apply for. These orders are designed to prevent further stalking activities by imposing specific prohibitions or requirements on the stalker. The eligibility for an SPO is based on evidence that the individual has engaged in stalking, poses a risk related to stalking, and that the order is necessary to protect someone from this risk. These orders can be applied against anyone residing in, or intending to visit, NothernIreland. The duration of these orders is addressed in Section 9, where an SPO can last for a minimum of two years or until further court order. The court may specify that some conditions within the SPO remain effective until further judicial review while setting others for fixed periods. This flexibility allows the protective measures to be adapted over time to match the needs of the situation. For their safety, affected individuals should report stalking incidents to the Police Service of NothernIreland (PSNI), enabling legal proceedings that could include the issuance of an SPO. Consulting legal advice and engaging with support services are also advisable steps to ensure comprehensive protection and support.","Under the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, an individual being harassed and stalked by an ex-partner can seek protection through a stalking protection order. This is a court-issued order that requires the perpetrator to stop stalking behavior and stay away from the victim.

To obtain a stalking protection order, the individual must:

1. Contact the police: The individual should report the harassment and stalking to the police, providing as much detail as possible about the incidents.
2. Meet with a police officer: A police officer will meet with the individual to discuss their concerns and gather more information about the situation.
3. File a complaint: The individual must file a formal complaint with the police, detailing the incidents of harassment and stalking.
4. Attend court: If the police decide that a stalking protection order is necessary, the individual must attend court, where a judge will consider the evidence and make a decision.

To ensure their safety, the individual can take the following steps:

1. Register with the police: The individual should register with the police as a victim of stalking, which will provide them with additional support and protection.
2. Seek support: The individual should seek support from friends, family, or a counselor to help cope with the emotional distress caused by the harassment and stalking.
3. Document incidents: The individual should keep a record of all incidents of harassment and stalking, including dates, times, locations, and any witnesses.
4. Avoid contact: The individual should avoid contact with the perpetrator, unless absolutely necessary, to minimize their risk of further harassment and stalking.

Additionally, the Protection from Sex-based Harassment in Public Act 2023 and the Online Safety Act 2023 may provide additional protections for individuals being harassed or stalked online. These laws prohibit intentional harassment, alarm, or distress caused by sex-related behavior in public and require internet service providers to remove and prevent access to such content.
