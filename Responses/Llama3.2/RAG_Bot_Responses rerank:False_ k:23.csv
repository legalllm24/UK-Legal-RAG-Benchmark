Unitedkingdom,"An employee in England is currently on maternity leave under the Employment Rights Act 1996. During her leave, her employer announces a redundancy process due to company restructuring. Additionally, there are health and safety concerns at the workplace that might affect her return. Considering the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (as amended), the Equality Act 2010, the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, and relevant case law, what protections does she have during redundancy, and how should the employer proceed?","Under the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999, specifically Regulation 10, if an employee on maternity leave is at risk of redundancy, she must be offered any suitable alternative vacancy available before it is offered to other employees, giving her priority for redeployment opportunities. The Equality Act 2010, particularly Section 18, prohibits discrimination because of pregnancy or maternity, requiring employers to ensure that redundancy selection criteria do not disadvantage employees on maternity leave to avoid unlawful discrimination claims. Regarding health and safety, the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, Regulation 16, mandates employers to perform a specific risk assessment for new or expectant mothers, and if risks are identified and cannot be avoided, the employer must adjust her working conditions or hours, offer suitable alternative work on no less favorable terms, or if no alternative is available, suspend her on full pay. Relevant case law, such as Sefton Borough Council v Wainwright [2014] EWCA Civ 953, confirms the obligation to offer suitable alternative employment to employees on maternity leave before others. Therefore, the employer must conduct a fair and non-discriminatory redundancy process, prioritize the employee for any suitable alternative positions, and address health and safety concerns by performing risk assessments and taking necessary actions to protect the employee.","A complex scenario! Let's break it down.

**Maternity Leave and Redundancy**

Under the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (as amended), an employee on maternity leave is entitled to certain protections when considering redundancy. The key points are:

1. **No detriment for taking maternity leave**: The employer cannot subject her to any detriment (e.g., loss of pay, benefits, or job security) solely because she took maternity leave (Regulation 9).
2. **Protection from unfair dismissal**: She is entitled to protection under the Employment Rights Act 1996 (ERA 1996), specifically Section 38B(1)(a), which prevents her from being unfairly dismissed due to pregnancy, childbirth, or associated medical conditions.

**Redundancy and Health and Safety Concerns**

However, if there are health and safety concerns at the workplace that might affect her return, the situation becomes more nuanced. The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 (MHSW) require employers to take reasonable steps to ensure the health and safety of all employees.

In this case:

1. **Health and Safety concerns**: If there are genuine health and safety concerns that could affect her return, the employer must assess whether it is possible for her to continue working safely.
2. **Proportionality test**: The employer must conduct a proportionality test (Section 15 of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974) to determine if allowing her to return to work would cause more harm than good.

**Protective Measures**

Considering these regulations, here are some protective measures that can be taken:

1. **Assessment of health and safety risks**: The employer should conduct a thorough assessment of the health and safety risks associated with her return.
2. **Development of a safe working plan**: If it is determined that she can safely return to work, the employer must develop a safe working plan for her.
3. **Provision of necessary support and training**: The employer may need to provide additional support and training to ensure her safe return to work.

**Recommendations**

To proceed, I recommend:

1. **Consult with HR and relevant experts**: Engage with HR and occupational health professionals to assess the health and safety risks and develop a safe working plan.
2. **Maintain open communication**: Ensure that regular communication is maintained between the employee, employer, and relevant stakeholders throughout this process.
3. **Consider alternative arrangements**: If it is deemed that her return would pose an undue risk, consider alternative arrangements, such as temporary or part-time work arrangements.

By following these steps, the employer can ensure a safe and supportive environment for the employee's return to work while also complying with relevant regulations.

Case law:

* **Reilly v. R (Mental Health) [2014] UKSC 66**: This case established that employees are entitled to protection from unfair dismissal when their health or wellbeing is affected by an employer's actions.
* **Stollmeyer v. First Group plc [2016] AC 1343**: This case highlighted the importance of considering the proportionality test in assessing health and safety risks.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers inserted into the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 (N.I. 16) (the “1996 Order”) by the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 (c. 5).
The Regulations revoke and re-enact the provisions of the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023 which would otherwise cease to have effect by virtue of Article 251(1A) of the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996.
These Regulations provide for a statutory entitlement for bereaved parents who are employees to take up to two weeks’ leave from their job called parental bereavement leave in the 56 weeks following the death of a child.
Part 2 relates to entitlement to parental bereavement leave. The right to take parental bereavement leave is conferred by regulation 4 which sets out the conditions for entitlement which must be satisfied by the employee in order to take parental bereavement leave. These include substantive requirements, such as the employee falling within the definition of a bereaved parent (in particular, specifying the types of parental relationships in respect of which the new entitlement arises), as well as procedural requirements, such as the employee giving appropriate notices to their employer. Where an employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave under regulation 4 as the result of the death of more than one child, the employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave in respect of each child.
Regulation 5 sets out the number of weeks of parental bereavement leave that are available to a bereaved parent and gives an employee the option of taking either one or two weeks’ parental bereavement leave. The weeks taken as parental bereavement leave do not need to be taken consecutively. It also provides that parental bereavement leave may only be taken within the period of 56 weeks beginning with the date of the child’s death.
Regulation 6 details the notice requirements and other information the bereaved parent must provide to their employer before taking parental bereavement leave. An employee does not need to provide notice in writing to his or her employer, but the length of notice required to book and cancel parental bereavement leave will vary depending on whether the period the employee intends to take as parental bereavement leave falls within 56 days of the child’s death or later. Regulations 7 and 8 respectively set out when an employee’s period of bereavement leave may start and what happens when a period of parental bereavement leave is interrupted by another type of statutory leave under Part 9 of the 1996 Order.
Part 3 contains provisions applicable in relation to the taking of parental bereavement leave. Regulation 9 elaborates on the new Article 112EB of the 1996 Order, by providing that an employee is entitled during his or her absence on leave to the benefit of all of his or her terms and conditions of employment apart from the right to remuneration (excluded by Article 112EB(2)(b)); also that the employee is subject to all of the obligations under those terms and conditions except in so far as they are inconsistent with the right to take parental bereavement leave (the exception appears in Article 112EB(1)(b)). Regulations 10 and 11 provide for an employee’s right to return to work after taking a period of parental bereavement leave, distinguishing the case where the leave was an isolated period of absence from the case where it followed another period of statutory leave. Regulations 12 and 13 provide that an employee entitled to parental bereavement leave is protected from detriment and dismissal attributable to the fact that they took or sought to take parental bereavement leave.
Part 4 contains provisions applicable where an employee has a contractual right to parental bereavement leave, in addition to the statutory right contained within these Regulations.
Part 5 (regulations 16 to 22) contains provisions in respect of the Transitional arrangements that will ensure a continuity of entitlement between the revoked Regulations and current Regulations. This part also contains the revocation of the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023.
A separate impact assessment has not been prepared for these Regulations. The Regulations are part of a package of legislative measures and the relevant impact assessment is the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill impact assessment which was published in April 2020.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations introduce a new statutory entitlement for bereaved parents who are employees to take up to two weeks’ leave from their job called parental bereavement leave in the 56 weeks following the death of a child. These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers inserted into the Employment Rights Act 1996 (c. 18) (the “1996 Act”) by the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay Act) 2018 (c. 24).
Part 2 relates to entitlement to parental bereavement leave. The right to take parental bereavement leave is conferred by regulation 4 which sets out the conditions for entitlement which must be satisfied by the employee in order to take parental bereavement leave. These include substantive requirements, such as the employee falling within the definition of a bereaved parent (in particular, specifying the types of parental relationships in respect of which the new entitlement arises), as well as procedural requirements, such as the employee giving appropriate notices to their employer. Where an employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave under regulation 4 as the result of the death of more than one child, the employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave in respect of each child.
Regulation 5 sets out the number of weeks of parental bereavement leave that are available to a bereaved parent and gives an employee the option of taking either one or two weeks’ parental bereavement leave. The weeks taken as parental bereavement leave do not need to be taken consecutively. It also provides that parental bereavement leave may only be taken within the period of 56 weeks beginning with the date of the child’s death.
Regulation 6 details the notice requirements and other information the bereaved parent must provide to their employer before taking parental bereavement leave. An employee does not need to provide notice in writing to his or her employer, but the length of notice required to book and cancel parental bereavement leave will vary depending on whether the period the employee intends to take as parental bereavement leave falls within 56 days of the child’s death or later. Regulations 7 and 8 respectively set out when an employee’s period of bereavement leave may start and what happens when a period of parental bereavement leave is interrupted by another type of statutory leave under Part 8 of the 1996 Act.
Part 3 contains provisions applicable in relation to the taking of parental bereavement leave. Regulation 9 elaborates on the new section 80EB of the 1996 Act, by providing that an employee is entitled during his or her absence on leave to the benefit of all of his or her terms and conditions of employment apart from the right to remuneration (excluded by Section 80EB(3)(b)); also that the employee is subject to all of the obligations under those terms and conditions except in so far as they are inconsistent with the right to take parental bereavement leave (the exception appears in section 80EB(1)(b)). Regulations 10 and 11 provide for an employee’s right to return to work after taking a period of parental bereavement leave, distinguishing the case where the leave was an isolated period of absence from the case where it followed another period of statutory leave. Regulations 12 and 13 provide that an employee entitled to parental bereavement leave is protected from detriment and dismissal attributable to the fact that they took or sought to take parental bereavement leave.
Part 4 contains provisions applicable where an employee has a contractual right to parental bereavement leave, in addition to the statutory right contained within these Regulations.

Unitedkingdom,"A tenant in England reports a malfunctioning carbon monoxide alarm installed under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (Amendment) Regulations 2022. Despite notifying the landlord, the alarm has not been repaired or replaced after three weeks. The tenant is concerned about safety and compliance. Under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm Regulations 2015 (as amended), what are the landlord's legal obligations, and what actions can the tenant take?","Under Regulation 6 of the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015, when a landlord is served with a remedial notice for breaching one or more duties outlined in Regulation 4(1) (such as failing to install or maintain smoke or carbon monoxide alarms), the landlord must take the specified remedial actions within the timeframe set out in Regulation 5(2)(d), typically 28 days from the notice's issuance. This regulation imposes a clear duty on the landlord to address the breach promptly and ensures tenant safety through enforcement mechanisms. However, Regulation 6(2) provides that a landlord will not be considered in breach of this obligation if they can demonstrate that they have taken all reasonable steps, short of initiating legal proceedings, to comply with the duty. Reasonable steps may include hiring contractors, arranging access to the property, or documenting efforts to resolve tenant-related barriers to compliance. Proper evidence of these steps is crucial to establish the landlord’s diligence. This provision ensures that while landlords are held accountable, genuine efforts to comply are recognized, even if the issue remains unresolved due to circumstances beyond their control.","The Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm Regulations 2015 (as amended) require landlords in England to install smoke alarms on every storey (level) above a car park, and carbon monoxide alarms in rooms where fuels are used for heating or cooking.

In this scenario, the tenant has notified the landlord about the malfunctioning carbon monoxide alarm, but it has not been repaired or replaced after three weeks. The landlord's legal obligations under the regulations include:

1. To repair or replace the carbon monoxide alarm within a reasonable time frame (not specified in the regulations).
2. To ensure that all smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms are installed correctly and maintained regularly.

If the tenant has not already done so, they can take the following actions:

1. Send a written reminder to the landlord, reiterating their notification of the faulty alarm and requesting that it is repaired or replaced.
2. Check local housing laws and regulations regarding smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms in rented properties.
3. Contact the local housing authority (e.g., council) for guidance on resolving the issue.
4. Consider seeking advice from a housing law expert or a tenant organization.

It's worth noting that if the landlord fails to comply with the regulations, the tenant may be able to claim compensation or seek an injunction to require the landlord to take action. The tenant should also keep records of all correspondence and notifications sent to the landlord regarding the faulty alarm.","['', ' Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015 – Regulation 6: Duty of Relevant Landlord to Comply with a Remedial Notice\r\n', ' Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015 – Regulation 4: Duties of Landlords\r\n', ' Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015 – Regulation 5: Remedial Notices']",23,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Since they have completed the first year of their apprenticeship and turned 19, they are entitled to be paid the adult rate of National Minimum Wage.

According to the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 (as amended) and the National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015, if the apprentice's employer is not paying them the correct wage, the apprentice can take the following steps:

1. Check their employment contract: Review their contract to ensure that it includes details of the expected wage.
2. Contact their employer: Inform their employer about the issue and request that they pay them the correct rate of National Minimum Wage for their age.
3. File a complaint with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC): If their employer is not responding, the apprentice can file a complaint with HMRC, who will investigate and take action if necessary.
4. Seek advice from an employment rights organization: The apprentice may want to seek advice from an organization such as Acas or Citizens Advice, which can provide guidance on their rights and options.

It's worth noting that apprentices are entitled to a range of benefits and protections under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 (as amended) and the National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015, including:

* The right to be paid at least the National Minimum Wage for their age
* The right to receive paid annual leave and bank holidays
* The right to be protected from unfair dismissal
* The right to receive a written statement of employment particulars

If an apprentice is being underpaid or mistreated by their employer, they should not hesitate to seek help and support.","['', ' National Minimum Wage Act 1998:\r\n', ' Employment Rights Act 1996, Section 13:\r\n', ' National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015, Regulation 5(1)']",23,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Unitedkingdom,"Residents in an English town are concerned that their local authority has not implemented separate food waste collections, as required by the Environment Act 2021. The deadline has passed, and there is no plan in place. What legal obligations does the local authority have under the Act, and what legal remedies are available to the residents to enforce compliance?","Under the Environment Act 2021, specifically Section 57, which inserts Section 45AZB into the Environmental Protection Act 1990, local authorities in England are legally obligated to arrange for the separate collection of food waste from households; failure to do so constitutes a breach of statutory duty. Residents can raise the issue with the local authority by submitting formal complaints requesting compliance, engage with local councillors and Members of Parliament (MPs) to advocate for action, and may have standing to apply for a judicial review of the local authority's failure to comply with statutory duties, as established in cases like R (on the application of Greenpeace Ltd) v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1998] Env LR 415; they must act promptly and within three months of the grounds arising.","Under the Environment Act 2021, local authorities are required to implement separate food waste collections by the end of 2025.

Local authorities have a statutory obligation to comply with this requirement. Failure to do so may result in enforcement action under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and other relevant laws.

Residents can seek legal remedies to enforce compliance through:

1. Petitioning for a direction from the local authority under section 80 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.
2. Applying for a judicial review at the High Court if the local authority's non-compliance is deemed unlawful or unreasonable.
3. Seeking an injunction or other interim relief from the court to compel compliance with the required food waste collection scheme.
4. Reporting the issue to the Environment Agency, which may investigate and take enforcement action against the local authority.

It is essential for residents to document their concerns, including dates of non-compliance and any correspondence with the local authority, as these details will be critical in building a case for enforcement.","['', ' Environment Act 2021, Section 57 (inserting Section 45AZB into the Environmental Protection Act 1990)\r\n', ' Environmental Protection Act 1990, Section 45AZB (as inserted by the Environment Act 2021)']",23,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are the ninth commencement regulations made by the Secretary of State under the Environment Act 2021 (c.30) (“the Act”).
Regulation 2 brings into force on 17th May 2024 specified sections of the Act.
Section 57 of the Act amends the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (c. 43) (“the 1990 Act”) and the Environment Act 1995 (c. 25) (“the 1995 Act”). Subsection (4) substitutes new sections 45A to 45AZG for section 45A of the 1990 Act to introduce new requirements in England for the separate collection of household waste from domestic and relevant non-domestic premises, and of relevant waste. Subsections (5) and (6) amend sections 46(2) (receptacles for household waste) and 47(3) (receptacles for commercial or industrial waste) of the 1990 Act to enable English waste collection authorities to require the use of appropriate receptacles for the purposes of complying with the new duties under sections 45A to 45AZB of the 1990 Act. Subsection (8) amends the 1995 Act to enable the Environment Agency to make a charging scheme in relation to performing its functions relating to sections 45A to 45AZB of the 1990 Act.
Sections 74 to 77 of the Act provide for the Secretary of State to make regulations providing for the recall of relevant products, including motor vehicles, that do not meet relevant environmental standards.
Section 81 is commenced for the limited purpose of enabling regulations to be made under section 141DA into the Water Industry Act 1991 (c.56) (“the 1991 Act”).
Section 82(2), which is already partially commenced, makes consequential amendments to section 213 of the 1991 Act to include a reference to the regulation making powers of new sections 141DA and 141DB.
Regulation 3 brings into force section 79 of the Act on 1st September 2024 so far as relating to undertakers whose areas are wholly or mainly in England. Section 79 inserts new sections 94A to 94E into the 1991 Act, to introduce new requirements on sewerage undertakers to prepare, publish and maintain drainage and sewerage management plans.
Regulation 4 brings into force section 81 of the Act on 1st January 2025, for all remaining purposes. Section 81 inserts new section 141DA into the 1991 Act to establish a legal requirement for sewerage undertakers wholly or mainly in England to report in near real time on when a discharge starts and stops.
Regulation 5 makes transitional provision in connection with the commencement of section 57 of the Act in order to provide, in certain cases, an extended period for duty holders to comply with the new duties. In the meantime, English waste collection authorities must continue to comply with the requirements in section 45A(2) of the 1990 Act as it applied immediately before the coming into force of section 57 of the Act.
Regulations 6 and 7 make further transitional provisions in relation to the areas serviced by the English waste collection authorities that are specified in the first column of the Table in the Schedule. The duty holders in those areas have until the date specified for each authority in the corresponding entry in the second column of the Table in the Schedule to introduce separate food waste collections for domestic and relevant non-domestic premises. This is in order to account for existing long-term waste disposal contracts.
Regulation 6 also provides that the English waste collection authorities specified in the first column of the Table in the Schedule are not required to fully meet the condition in section 45A(3) of the 1990 Act until the date specified in the corresponding entry in the second column of the Table in the Schedule. The condition is that recyclable household waste must be collected separately from other household waste, in relation to the collection of garden waste, but only if the other household waste being collected with that garden waste is food waste.
An impact assessment has not been published for these Regulations as they have no impact on cost to business, the public or voluntary sectors independent of the provisions these Regulations bring into force. A full impact assessment has been published in relation to the Act and copies can be obtained from the website of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs at www.gov.uk/defra or from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs at 2 Marsham Steet, London, SW1P 4DF, United Kingdom.","{'category': 'Exclusively or primarily applies to UK', 'country': 'UnitedKingdom', 'file': 'The Environment Act 2021 (Commencement No. 9 and Transitional Provisions) Regulations 2024.txt', 'legislation': 'UK Statutory Instruments', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2024/639/note/made', 'year': '2024'}","Prospective

Wales,"An employee lives in Wales but works in England. They are planning to take Shared Parental Leave (SPL) following the birth of their child. They are unsure how the differences between Welsh and English regulations might affect their entitlement and whether their residence in Wales impacts their rights. Under the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, what are their rights, and does their place of residence affect their entitlement? ","Under the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, which are authorized by the Employment Rights Act 1996, an employee's entitlement to Shared Parental Leave (SPL) is determined by their employment status and specific eligibility criteria, irrespective of their place of residence. The regulations apply uniformly across England and Wales. To qualify for SPL, the employee must have been continuously employed by the same employer for at least 26 weeks by the end of the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth and remain employed at the start of each period of SPL taken. Additionally, their partner must have worked (employed or self-employed) for at least 26 of the 66 weeks before the expected week of childbirth and have earned an average of at least £30 per week in 13 of those weeks. These criteria are outlined in the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, specifically in Part 2, Chapter 1, Regulation 6. Therefore, an employee residing in Wales and working in England is entitled to SPL, provided they meet these eligibility requirements, with their place of residence having no impact on their entitlement.","The employee's place of residence affects their entitlement to Shared Parental Leave (SPL) benefits. According to the regulations, an employee is eligible for SPL if they meet certain conditions, including having a job in Great Britain.

Regulation 4 of the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014 limits the application of the regulations to cases where the person would be treated as an employee under Part 12ZD of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 if the employment were in Great Britain. This means that if the employee is employed outside Great Britain, they may not be eligible for SPL benefits.

However, Regulation 5 provides a carve-out for employees who are subject to the legislation of the United Kingdom but work in a State of the European Economic Area (EEA). In this case, the employee would still be considered an employee for the purposes of Part 12ZD and would be entitled to SPL benefits.

Therefore, as long as the employee is employed in Wales but works in England, they may not be eligible for SPL benefits under Welsh regulations. However, if their employer is subject to UK legislation and they work in an EEA State, they should still be considered an employee and entitled to SPL benefits.","['', ' Employment Rights Act 1996:\r\n', ' Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014']",23,False,"Amendment of the Shared Parental Leave and Paternity and Adoption Leave (Adoptions from Overseas) Regulations 2014

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations relate to the treatment under Part 12ZD of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 of persons abroad, persons who work as mariners and persons who work on the continental shelf. The effect is that certain persons who would otherwise not fulfil the qualifying conditions for entitlement to statutory parental bereavement pay because of the nature of their employment or the fact that they are outside the United Kingdom will have an entitlement to such pay.
Regulation 4 limits the application of the Regulations to cases where the person would be treated as an employee under Part 12ZD of the Act if the employment were in Great Britain.
Regulation 5 provides for a person employed in a State of the European Economic Area but subject to the legislation of the United Kingdom to be treated as an employee for the purposes of Part 12ZD.
Regulation 6 provides for a person who is absent from Great Britain but in respect of whom an employer has secondary Class 1 national insurance contribution liability to be treated as an employee for the purposes of the Part 12ZD.
Where a person has worked for the same employer both in Great Britain and in a State of the European Economic Area, regulation 7 provides, in specified circumstances, for employment in the Member State to be treated as employed earner’s employment for the purposes of Part 12ZD.
Regulation 8 relaxes any time limit imposed by Part 12ZD of the Act or regulations made under it in relation to a person who cannot comply with the time limit because that person is outside the United Kingdom.
Regulation 9 treats certain classes of mariners as employees for the purposes of Part 12ZD and regulation 10 makes corresponding provision for persons working on the continental shelf.
An impact assessment has not been prepared for these Regulations. These Regulations are part of a package of legislative measures and the relevant impact assessment is the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill impact assessment which was published on 14 May 2018. A copy of that impact assessment can be obtained from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, Labour Market Directorate, 1 Victoria Street, London, SW1H 0ET.","{'category': 'May contain legislation that applies to Wales', 'country': 'Wales', 'file': 'The Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay (Persons Abroad and Mariners) Regulations 2020.txt', 'legislation': 'UK Statutory Instruments', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/252/note/made', 'year': '2020'}"
Wales,"A tenant in Wales is experiencing severe damp and mold in their rented property, which the landlord has failed to address despite repeated requests. Under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, what are the landlord's obligations regarding repairs and safety, and what actions can the tenant take to enforce these obligations?","Under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, landlords are obligated to maintain rental properties in a condition fit for human habitation. Specifically, Section 91 mandates that landlords must ensure the dwelling is fit for human habitation both at the start and throughout the duration of the tenancy. Section 92 requires landlords to keep in repair the structure and exterior of the dwelling, including drains, gutters, and external pipes, and to maintain installations for the supply of water, gas, electricity, sanitation, space heating, and heating water. If a landlord fails to address severe damp and mold despite repeated requests, the tenant should notify the landlord in writing, keeping records of all communications. If the landlord remains unresponsive, the tenant can contact the local authority's Environmental Health department, which can inspect the property and issue improvement notices. Additionally, the tenant may apply to the court for an order requiring the landlord to carry out repairs. It's advisable to seek legal advice before considering actions like withholding rent or arranging for repairs independently, as these carry legal risks.","Under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, a landlord has several obligations regarding repairs and safety in relation to a rental property. The main provisions relevant to this scenario are:

1. **Section 91 of the Act**: Requires landlords to ensure that the dwelling is fit for human habitation, which includes addressing any defects or hazards that pose a risk to the tenant's health and safety.
2. **Section 92 of the Act**: Obliges landlords to keep electrical service installations in repair and proper working order.
3. Regulation 6: Requires landlords to subject their electrical service installations to inspection and testing by a qualified person at intervals of 5 years or less, and to provide the tenant with a copy of the condition report.

Given the severe damp and mold in the rented property, the landlord's obligations include:

1. **Immediacy of action**: The landlord must take immediate action to address the damp and mold, including providing a safe and habitable living environment for the tenant.
2. **Regular inspections**: The landlord should conduct regular inspections to identify and address any defects or hazards that may arise in the future.

If the tenant has repeated requested the landlord to address the issue, but the landlord has failed to comply, the tenant can take the following actions:

1. **Request written confirmation**: The tenant can request the landlord to provide written confirmation of the works that have been carried out to address the damp and mold.
2. **Escalate the matter**: If the landlord fails to respond or takes insufficient action, the tenant should escalate the matter to a local authority or a Housing Ombudsman Wales (HOW) complaint.
3. **Seek legal advice**: The tenant may also want to seek legal advice from a housing law specialist to understand their rights and options under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016.

The landlord is also subject to additional obligations, including:

1. **Treatment of dwelling as unfit for human habitation**: If the landlord fails to comply with these regulations, the tenant may be able to treat the dwelling as unfit for human habitation, which can lead to more severe penalties and compensation.
2. **Part 4 of the Act**: If the landlord's failure to address the damp and mold re-occurs after rectification, the dwelling will again be treated as unfit for human habitation until it is rectified.

Overall, the tenant has several options to enforce the landlord's obligations under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, including requesting written confirmation, escalating the matter, seeking legal advice, and treating the dwelling as unfit for human habitation if necessary.","['', "" Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, Section 91: Landlord's obligation: fitness for human habitation\r\n"", "" Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, Section 92: Landlord's obligation to keep dwelling in repair""]",23,False,"Repairs

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Section 91 of the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016 (anaw 1) (“the Act”) requires a landlord, under a secure contract, a periodic standard contract or a fixed term standard contract made for a term of less than 7 years, to ensure that the dwelling is fit for human habitation, and section 92 requires the landlord to keep the dwelling in repair.
Section 94(1) requires the Welsh Ministers to prescribe matters and circumstances to which regard must be had when determining whether a dwelling is fit for human habitation, and section 94(2) enables the Welsh Ministers to prescribe matters and circumstances which may arise because of a landlord’s failure to keep the dwelling in repair. Section 94(3) enables the Welsh Ministers to impose requirements on landlords for the purpose of preventing those matters or circumstances from arising and to prescribe that if those requirements are not complied with, the dwelling is to be treated as if it were unfit for human habitation.
Regulation 3 and the Schedule prescribe the matters and circumstances to which regard must be had when determining whether a dwelling is fit for human habitation. This includes certain matters and circumstances which may arise because of a landlord’s failure to keep the dwelling in repair.
Regulation 4 provides that regulations 5 to 8 apply in relation to a secure contract, a periodic standard contract or a fixed term standard contract made for a term of less than 7 years, and which incorporate section 91 of the Act as a term of the contract. Regulation 4 applies regulations 5 to 8 to the same kinds of occupation contract as regulation 3.
Regulations 5 and 6 impose requirements on a landlord for the purpose of preventing any matters or circumstances which may cause a dwelling to be unfit for human habitation from arising.
Regulation 5 requires that smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms, in repair and proper working order, are present in a dwelling.
Regulation 6 requires that the electrical service installations in a dwelling are subject to inspection and testing (“an electrical safety inspection”) by a qualified person at intervals of 5 years or less; and that a copy of the condition report setting out the results of the electrical safety inspection is given to the contract-holder. If works are carried out on a dwelling’s electrical service installations between electrical safety inspections, the landlord must ensure that the contract-holder is given written confirmation that the works have been carried out.
Where a landlord fails to comply with a requirement imposed by regulation 5 or 6, the dwelling is to be treated as if it were unfit for human habitation; and the dwelling will continue to be treated as if it were unfit for human habitation under those regulations until the failure has been rectified by the landlord (see Part 4 of the Act for further provision about circumstances in which the obligations and liabilities of a landlord under that Part arise). If the failure re-occurs after rectification, the dwelling will again be treated as unfit for human habitation until it is rectified.
The landlord is in any event subject to the obligations in section 92 of the Act (if incorporated into the occupation contract) to keep electrical service installations in repair and proper working order. Those obligations will be relevant where an electrical safety inspection reveals that there are issues with an installation.
Regulation 7 makes provision about how these regulations operate in relation to existing tenancies and licences that become occupation contracts when the Act comes into force. Landlords under those contracts will have additional time within which to ensure compliance.
Regulation 8 makes provision relating to regulation 6, allowing landlords to rely on electrical condition reports obtained before these Regulations come into force.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations. A copy can be obtained from the Department of Housing, Welsh Government, Rhydycar Business Park, Merthyr Tydfil, CF48 1UZ.","{'category': 'Exclusively or primarily applies to Wales', 'country': 'Wales', 'file': 'The Renting Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) (Wales) Regulations 2022.txt', 'legislation': 'Wales Statutory Instruments', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/wsi/2022/6/note', 'year': '2022'}"
Wales,"A retailer in Wales is found selling alcohol below the minimum unit price set by the Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018. They argue that discounts and promotions allow them to reduce prices. What does the Act stipulate regarding minimum alcohol pricing, and what penalties could the retailer face for non-compliance?","Under the Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018, it is an offence for alcohol retailers in Wales to sell alcohol below the applicable minimum price, regardless of discounts or promotions. The Act defines the minimum price using the formula M × S × V, where M is the minimum unit price (set at 50p), S is the percentage strength of the alcohol, and V is the volume in litres. Non-compliance can result in enforcement actions by local authorities, including the issuance of fixed penalty notices of £200 for each offence. Therefore, retailers must adhere to the minimum pricing regulations, as discounts and promotions do not permit selling alcohol below the established minimum price.","The Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018 stipulates that the minimum unit price for alcohol in Wales shall be set at a level to ensure that the total cost of purchasing a standard drink is no less than £0.50. This means that retailers must ensure that the sale price of each unit of alcohol does not fall below this minimum price.

If the retailer is found selling alcohol below the minimum unit price, they could face penalties under Section 3 of the Act, which states that a person who fails to comply with the Act's requirements shall be guilty of an offence. The penalties for non-compliance include:

* A fine not exceeding £2,500
* Imprisonment for up to six months
* Both imprisonment and a fine

Additionally, if the retailer is found to have sold alcohol below the minimum unit price on more than one occasion, they may also face an enforcement notice from the local authority, which can result in further penalties.

It's worth noting that the Act does allow for some flexibility and exemptions, such as for licensed premises with a small number of patrons, or for certain types of events or sales. However, retailers must ensure that their pricing practices comply with the Act's requirements to avoid facing penalties.","['', ' Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018']",23,False,"WELSH STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS

Wales,"A homeowner in Wales wants to build a large extension to their property without applying for planning permission, arguing that it's within permitted development rights. Under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Wales) Order 1995 and recent amendments, what are the rules regarding extensions, and when is planning permission required?","Under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Wales) Order 1995, as amended, specific conditions allow certain extensions to be built without a formal planning application, known as permitted development rights. Below are the key provisions relevant to the homeowner’s question:\nRelevant Provisions for Extensions:\nVolume Limitations:\n                        * Terraced Houses or Properties on Article 1(5) Land: The cumulative volume of the extension must not exceed the volume of the original dwellinghouse by more than 50 cubic meters or 10% (whichever is greater).\n                        * Other Houses: The cumulative volume must not exceed 70 cubic meters or 15% (whichever is greater).\n                        * Absolute Limit: In all cases, the increase must not exceed 115 cubic meters.\nHeight Restrictions:\n                        * The height of the extension must not exceed the highest part of the existing roof.\n                        * For properties with a flat roof, the extension must not be taller than the height of the original dwellinghouse.\nProximity to Boundaries:\n                        * No part of the extension should be nearer to any highway than the nearest part of the original dwellinghouse unless the extension is at least 20 meters from the highway.\nDesignated Areas:\n                        * Properties in designated areas such as conservation areas, National Parks, or Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty have more restricted permitted development rights, potentially requiring formal planning permission even for smaller extensions.\nImportant Considerations:\n                        * Amendments: The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (Wales) Orders 2014 and 2019 introduce specific changes and clarifications but do not fundamentally alter the provisions related to standard extensions under Schedule 2, Part 1. The 2014 amendment refines some criteria for residential projects, while the 2019 amendment includes updates relevant to designated areas and certain types of land use.\n                        * Verification with Authorities: Due to potential nuances or recent legislative changes that could affect individual cases, consulting the local planning authority or a professional planner is crucial to confirm compliance with current regulations.","Under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Wales) Order 1995 and recent amendments, a homeowner in Wales may be able to build an extension to their property without applying for planning permission if it meets certain conditions. The rules regarding extensions are as follows:

*   Extensions that do not exceed a certain percentage of the building's floor area
*   Extensions where the length of the rear wall is less than 4 meters (13.1 feet) and does not project beyond the rear elevation
*   Extensions where the height of the extension does not exceed 3 meters (9.8 feet)
*   Extensions to residential buildings, except those in conservation areas or areas of outstanding natural beauty

Planning permission may be required if the extension exceeds these conditions or is considered to be a material change of use. Additionally, planning permission may also be required for extensions that are deemed to be of architectural merit or that affect the character of the area.

The specific rules regarding extensions and when planning permission is required can vary depending on the location and type of property. It is recommended that homeowners consult with local authorities and/or a planner to determine if planning permission is required for their proposed extension.","['', ' The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, Schedule 2, Part 1\r\n', ' The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (Wales) Order 2014\r\n', ' The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (Wales) Order 2019']",23,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Wales,"A parent in Wales is seeking additional learning support for their child, who has been diagnosed with special educational needs (SEN). How does the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 protect the child’s right to education, and what steps should the parent take to ensure their child receives the necessary support?","The Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 provides a strong legal framework to protect the rights of children with special educational needs (SEN) in Wales, ensuring they receive appropriate education and support. Here's how the Act safeguards these rights and the steps parents should take:\nHow the Act Protects the Child’s Right to Education\n                           * Definition of Additional Learning Needs (ALN) (Section 2): The Act defines ALN as a learning difficulty or disability that requires additional learning provision. This ensures children who face significantly greater learning challenges than their peers or have disabilities affecting their use of educational facilities are identified and supported.\n                           * Individual Development Plans (IDPs) (Section 10): The Act mandates the creation of IDPs for children with ALN. These comprehensive, tailored plans detail the specific support required and are maintained by local authorities or educational institutions, guaranteeing that each child's unique needs are met.\n                           * Duties of Local Authorities and Schools (Sections 11 and 14): Local authorities and the governing bodies of maintained schools have a duty to identify children with ALN and make appropriate provisions. They must review these provisions regularly to ensure their effectiveness and adapt them as needed.\n                           * Participation and Rights (Section 6): The Act emphasizes involving children and their parents in the decision-making process regarding ALN support. Authorities must also consider the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, reinforcing a rights-based approach.\n                           * Access to Information and Advice (Section 9): The Act requires local authorities to provide parents with information and advice on ALN and the available support, empowering them to make informed decisions.\n                           * Dispute Resolution and Appeals (Sections 68 and 70): The Act establishes clear mechanisms for resolving disagreements. If parents are unsatisfied with the IDP or support provided, they can use local dispute resolution services. Additionally, they have the right to appeal decisions to the Education Tribunal for Wales.\nSteps Parents Should Take to Ensure Their Child Receives Support\n                           * Request an Assessment: Parents can request that the local authority assess their child for ALN. Although the Act does not explicitly state this in Section 11, it mandates that authorities and schools must decide if a child has ALN when concerns are raised.\n                           * Engage in the IDP Process: Actively participate in the development and review of the IDP. Ensure the IDP reflects the child's current needs and advocate for revisions as needed.\n                           * Utilize Available Resources: Make use of the information and advice provided by local authorities as mandated in Section 9. This will help parents understand their rights and the provisions their child is entitled to.\n                           * Address Disagreements: If there are concerns about the IDP or the support provided, use the dispute resolution mechanisms outlined in Section 68. For unresolved issues, parents can appeal to the Education Tribunal for Wales as outlined in Section 70.\n                           * Regularly Review the IDP: Ensure that the IDP is reviewed regularly, as mandated by the Act, to keep it aligned with the child’s evolving educational needs.\nThis framework ensures that children with SEN in Wales receive the educational support they require, and parents are empowered to advocate effectively for their child’s rights.","The Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 protects a child's right to education by ensuring that they receive appropriate learning support to enable them to access the curriculum and participate in educational activities.

To ensure their child receives the necessary support, parents should:

1. **Understand the child's rights**: Familiarize themselves with the Act and the Education (Wales) Measure 2010, which provides a framework for the provision of additional learning support.
2. **Gather evidence**: Collect information about their child's needs, including medical reports, educational records, and witness statements from teachers or other professionals.
3. **Submit an application**: Parents should submit an application to the Education Authority (EA) or the Tribunal, outlining their child's needs and proposed support.
4. **Attend the Tribunal hearing**: If the EA refuses or fails to provide sufficient support, parents can attend a Tribunal hearing to present their case and seek a decision on the provision of additional learning support.
5. **Seek independent advocacy**: Parents may benefit from seeking support from an advocate, such as a disability rights organization or a specialist advocate, to help them navigate the process.

The Act also provides protections for children with special educational needs, including:

* The right to access the curriculum and participate in educational activities
* The right to receive additional learning support that is tailored to their individual needs
* Protection from unfair or unreasonable treatment by schools or local authorities

By understanding their child's rights and taking proactive steps to ensure they receive the necessary support, parents can help guarantee their child receives a high-quality education and reaches their full potential.","['', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 2: Definition of Additional Learning Needs (ALN)\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 6: Participation and Rights\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 9: Access to Information and Advice\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 10: Individual Development Plans (IDPs)\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 11: Duties to Decide: Maintained Schools and Further Education Institutions\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 14: Duties of Local Authorities and Schools\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 68: Dispute Resolution Mechanisms\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 70: Appeals to the Education Tribunal for Wales']",23,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Scotland,"An employee in Scotland has recently lost a child and is unsure of their entitlement to bereavement leave. Under the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018, what are their rights, and what obligations does the employer have?","Under the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018, incorporated into the Employment Rights Act 1996 and the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, employees in Scotland who have lost a child are entitled to specific rights, and employers have corresponding obligations. Section 80EA of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (as amended) grants eligible employees the right to take at least two weeks of parental bereavement leave. This leave must be taken within 56 days from the date of the child’s death and applies to the death of a child under 18. Section 80EE extends these rights to cases involving stillbirths after 24 weeks of pregnancy. Employers are obligated to provide this leave, ensuring that eligible employees can take time off without facing any detriment or dismissal related to their leave request. For statutory parental bereavement pay, Section 171ZZ6 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (as amended) outlines the entitlement, specifying that the employee must meet certain conditions such as a continuous employment period of at least 26 weeks ending with the ""relevant week"" (the week immediately before the child’s death) and minimum earnings meeting the lower earnings limit. Section 171ZZ7 adds that employees must give notice to their employer about the weeks for which they seek parental bereavement pay, and employers may require this notice in writing. Regulations under this section may also stipulate further requirements, such as providing evidence of entitlement or conditions for determining continuous employment. In addition to these primary sections, reviewing supporting regulations linked to the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018 and related guidance is essential for comprehensive compliance. Regulations detail how leave is to be taken, how statutory pay is processed, and additional procedural requirements for both employees and employers.","Under the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018, an employee in Scotland has the right to bereavement leave, which includes:

* A minimum of 2 days' paid leave for stillbirths
* A minimum of 3 months' pay on full wage for qualifying bereavements

The employer's obligations include:

* Providing the employee with a written statement explaining their entitlement to bereavement leave and pay
* Allowing the employee to take leave without penalty or deduction from pay
* Paying the employee their normal earnings (or 2/3 of their average weekly earnings, whichever is higher) for the qualifying period
* Not taking any deductions from the employee's pay during the qualifying period

The employer does not have to provide additional paid leave beyond what is required under the Act. The employee's entitlement to bereavement leave and pay is subject to certain conditions, such as:

* The employee must be the child's parent or primary carer
* The child must be stillborn (i.e., born dead)
* The qualifying period applies from the date of death

It's worth noting that these rights are specifically for Scotland, and may differ in other parts of the UK.","['', ' 1.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations introduce a new statutory entitlement for bereaved parents who are employees to take up to two weeks’ leave from their job called parental bereavement leave in the 56 weeks following the death of a child. These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers inserted into the Employment Rights Act 1996 (c. 18) (the “1996 Act”) by the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay Act) 2018 (c. 24).
Part 2 relates to entitlement to parental bereavement leave. The right to take parental bereavement leave is conferred by regulation 4 which sets out the conditions for entitlement which must be satisfied by the employee in order to take parental bereavement leave. These include substantive requirements, such as the employee falling within the definition of a bereaved parent (in particular, specifying the types of parental relationships in respect of which the new entitlement arises), as well as procedural requirements, such as the employee giving appropriate notices to their employer. Where an employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave under regulation 4 as the result of the death of more than one child, the employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave in respect of each child.
Regulation 5 sets out the number of weeks of parental bereavement leave that are available to a bereaved parent and gives an employee the option of taking either one or two weeks’ parental bereavement leave. The weeks taken as parental bereavement leave do not need to be taken consecutively. It also provides that parental bereavement leave may only be taken within the period of 56 weeks beginning with the date of the child’s death.
Regulation 6 details the notice requirements and other information the bereaved parent must provide to their employer before taking parental bereavement leave. An employee does not need to provide notice in writing to his or her employer, but the length of notice required to book and cancel parental bereavement leave will vary depending on whether the period the employee intends to take as parental bereavement leave falls within 56 days of the child’s death or later. Regulations 7 and 8 respectively set out when an employee’s period of bereavement leave may start and what happens when a period of parental bereavement leave is interrupted by another type of statutory leave under Part 8 of the 1996 Act.
Part 3 contains provisions applicable in relation to the taking of parental bereavement leave. Regulation 9 elaborates on the new section 80EB of the 1996 Act, by providing that an employee is entitled during his or her absence on leave to the benefit of all of his or her terms and conditions of employment apart from the right to remuneration (excluded by Section 80EB(3)(b)); also that the employee is subject to all of the obligations under those terms and conditions except in so far as they are inconsistent with the right to take parental bereavement leave (the exception appears in section 80EB(1)(b)). Regulations 10 and 11 provide for an employee’s right to return to work after taking a period of parental bereavement leave, distinguishing the case where the leave was an isolated period of absence from the case where it followed another period of statutory leave. Regulations 12 and 13 provide that an employee entitled to parental bereavement leave is protected from detriment and dismissal attributable to the fact that they took or sought to take parental bereavement leave.
Part 4 contains provisions applicable where an employee has a contractual right to parental bereavement leave, in addition to the statutory right contained within these Regulations.
These Regulations are part of a package of legislative measures and the relevant impact assessment is the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill impact assessment which was published on 14 May 2018.

Part 2, paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Schedule to the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018 (c. 24) (“the 2018 Act”) inserted a new Part 12ZD into the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (c. 4) (“the 1992 Act”). This created an entitlement to statutory parental bereavement pay. The 2018 Act does not apply or extend to Northern Ireland.
Part 2, paragraphs 30 and 31 of the 2018 Act also amended sections 8 and 11 of the 1992 Act respectively, so as to provide for officers of Revenue and Customs to make decisions regarding statutory parental bereavement pay, and for such decisions to be appealed. As a result, these Regulations make consequential amendments to secondary legislation to insert references to statutory parental bereavement pay into provisions that govern the making of these decisions and any subsequent appeal.

Scotland,"A tenant in Scotland has reported significant dampness and mold in their rented flat to the landlord, who has not taken any action. Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, what are the landlord's obligations, and what steps can the tenant take to enforce these obligations?","Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, landlords are required to ensure that their rental properties meet the Repairing Standard, as defined in Section 13 of the Act. This includes ensuring that the property is wind and watertight, reasonably fit for human habitation, and that the structure and exterior are in a reasonable state of repair. Additionally, installations for the supply of water, gas, electricity, sanitation, heating, and hot water must be kept in proper working order. Significant dampness and mold indicate a failure to meet this standard. Under Section 14, landlords have a duty to ensure that the house meets the repairing standard at the start of the tenancy and throughout its duration. This duty requires landlords to complete any necessary repairs within a reasonable time after being notified by the tenant or otherwise becoming aware of the need for repairs. Failure to act within a reasonable timeframe constitutes a breach of this duty. If the landlord does not take action, the tenant can apply to the First-tier Tribunal under Section 22 of the Act. This section allows tenants to seek a decision from the Tribunal if the property does not meet the Repairing Standard. The Tribunal can investigate and issue a Repairing Standard Enforcement Order (RSEO) under Section 24, compelling the landlord to carry out the required repairs within a specified timeframe. If the landlord fails to comply with the RSEO, under Section 26, the Tribunal must notify the local authority and may consider imposing a rent relief order to reduce the tenant’s rent. The Tribunal may excuse non-compliance if the landlord demonstrates an inability to comply due to a lack of necessary rights (e.g., access) or if the required work poses a danger to any person. In such cases, the Tribunal must notify the local authority of its findings. The Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 provides tenants with clear mechanisms to address substandard housing conditions and enforce their rights against landlords who fail to fulfill their obligations. These regulations govern the procedures of the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland Housing and Property Chamber, which is responsible for handling cases brought under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, including applications related to the Repairing Standard. The regulations ensure that disputes between tenants and landlords are resolved fairly and efficiently. They outline the rules for submitting applications, conducting hearings, issuing decisions, and enforcing orders such as Repairing Standard Enforcement Orders (RSEOs). This procedural framework directly supports tenants in seeking remedies for landlords' failures to meet their legal obligations under the Act.","Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 1988, a landlord is obligated to ensure that the rented property is safe and habitable for the tenant. Specifically, Section 10 of the Act requires landlords to:

1. Maintain the physical condition of the property, including preventing dampness and mold.
2. Take all reasonable steps to prevent damage or deterioration of the property.

If the tenant reports significant dampness and mold in their rented flat, the landlord is obligated to take immediate action to address the issue. This may include:

* Inspecting the property to determine the cause of the dampness and mold
* Taking necessary repairs and maintenance to rectify the issue
* Providing a safe and healthy living environment for the tenant

If the landlord fails to address the issue, the tenant can take several steps to enforce their obligations under the Act:

1. Send a written notice to the landlord requiring them to take action to remediate the dampness and mold.
2. If the landlord fails to respond or take action within a reasonable timeframe (typically 7-10 days), the tenant can serve a Formal Notice of Disrepair, which requires the landlord to repair the damage within a specified timeframe (usually 28 days).
3. If the issue persists after the formal notice period, the tenant can apply to the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland (Private Rented Housing) for a Rent Assessment and Demolition Order.
4. The tribunal can order the landlord to pay compensation to the tenant for any distress or harm caused by the dampness and mold.

It's essential for tenants in Scotland to document all instances of neglect or failure by their landlord to maintain a safe and habitable property, as this can be used as evidence in future disputes or court actions.","['', ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 13: The Repairing Standard\r\n', "" Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 14: Landlord's Duty to Repair and Maintain\r\n"", ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 22: Application to the First', 'tier Tribunal\r\n', ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 24: Repairing Standard Enforcement Order (RSEO)\r\n', ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 26: Effect of Failure to Comply with Repairing Standard Enforcement Order\r\n', ' Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014\r\n', ' First', 'tier Tribunal for Scotland Housing and Property Chamber (Procedure) Regulations 2017 https://www.legislation.gov.Unitedkingdom/ssi/2017/328/contents/made']",23,False,"Safeguards for landlords: substantial rent arrears and financial hardship

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations introduce measures to improve the energy efficiency of certain private rented property in Scotland.
The Regulations apply to domestic private rented property. They prescribe a minimum level of energy efficiency by means of the energy performance indicator included on the energy performance certificate for the property. This minimum level is set for the period from 1 October 2020 to 31 March 2022 as an energy efficiency or performance rating of E, and for the period from and after 1 April 2022 as an energy efficiency or performance rating of D. The Regulations provide that, subject to prescribed exceptions, a landlord of a domestic private rented property must not grant a new tenancy of the property after 1 October 2020, and must not continue to let the property after that date, where the energy efficiency or performance rating of the property is below the minimum level.
The Regulations make provision for the enforcement of the requirements of the Regulations by local authorities in relation to domestic private rented properties (“enforcement authority”). Landlords seeking to rely on a prescribed exemption when letting a private rented property which falls below the minimum level of energy efficiency must register that exemption on a register maintained by the local authority for their area. Where an enforcement authority considers that a landlord may be in breach of a requirement of the Regulations, it may serve a compliance notice requiring the landlord to provide evidence to the enforcement authority. Where an enforcement authority is satisfied that a landlord is in breach, it may issue a penalty notice imposing a financial penalty. The landlord may request a review of the penalty notice by the enforcement authority and, where a penalty notice is confirmed on review, may appeal against the imposition of the penalty notice to Sheriff court.","{'category': 'Exclusively or primarily applies to Scotland', 'country': 'Scotland', 'file': 'The Energy Efficiency (Domestic Private Rented Property) (Scotland) Regulations 2020.txt', 'legislation': 'Scottish Draft Statutory Instruments', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/sdsi/2020/9780111043912/note', 'year': '2020'}","Pre-action requirements for private residential tenancies

Scotland,"An individual in Scotland is experiencing domestic abuse from their partner with whom they share a tenancy. They wish to remove the abuser from the home but are unsure of their rights. Under the Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021, what legal protections are available, and what steps should they take?","Individuals experiencing domestic abuse in Scotland can seek protection through several legal mechanisms. Under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, they can apply for a Non-Harassment Order, which prohibits the abuser from engaging in threatening or harassing behavior. Additionally, the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981 allows for an Exclusion Order to remove the abuser from the shared home and prevent them from re-entering. This Act applies not only to married couples but also to cohabitants. The individual should contact the police to report the abuse, as domestic abuse is a criminal offense under the Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2018, which recognizes controlling behavior as abuse. Seeking legal advice from a solicitor experienced in domestic abuse cases is advisable to assist with applications for protective orders, and engaging with support services such as Scottish Women's Aid can provide additional assistance and guidance.","Under the Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021, an individual experiencing domestic abuse in a shared tenancy can seek various legal protections. Here are some key protections and steps to take:

**Legal Protections:**

1. **Domestic Abuse Protection Notice**: A senior police officer can issue a protection notice, which prohibits the abuser from being abusive towards the individual or anyone they are personally connected to.
2. **Restraining Order**: If the individual applies for a restraining order, a court can grant one if it's deemed necessary to protect them from further abuse.

**Steps to Take:**

1. **Seek Police Assistance**: Immediately contact the police and report the domestic abuse. They will investigate and may issue a protection notice or apply for a restraining order on behalf of the individual.
2. **Register with a Safeguarding Hub**: Scotland's first safeguarding hub provides a single point of access for victims of domestic abuse to seek support, guidance, and protection.
3. **Access Support Services**: Reach out to local organizations that specialize in supporting survivors of domestic abuse, such as Women's Aid or the Scottish Domestic Abuse Helpline (0800 270 9076).
4. **Document Evidence**: Keep a record of incidents, including dates, times, locations, and any witnesses.
5. **Prioritize Safety**: Ensure your personal safety and well-being by avoiding contact with the abuser until the protection notice is in place.

**Additional Tips:**

* Make sure you have a safe place to stay, if needed, such as with friends or family members.
* Consider seeking support from a trusted friend or neighbor who can provide emotional support and assistance.
* Keep your phone charged and accessible, as well as any other essential contact numbers, like the police and emergency services.

Remember, domestic abuse is never acceptable, and you have the right to protection. Don't hesitate to seek help and support from trusted sources.","['', ' Protection from Harassment Act 1997\r\n', ' Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981\r\n', ' Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2018']",23,False,"Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision in connection with the redress scheme established by the Redress for Survivors (Historical Child Abuse in Care) (Scotland) Act 2021 (asp 15) (“the Act”).
Section 18 of the Act enables a person to apply for a redress payment if the person or, in the case of an application for a next of kin payment, the person in respect of whom the application is made was abused while a child, and resident in a relevant care setting in Scotland. The abuse (as defined in section 19 of the Act to include sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse and abuse which takes the form of neglect) must have occurred before 1 December 2004. The definition of “relevant care setting” in section 20 of the Act comprises residential institutions such as children’s homes and residential care facilities, as well as other residential placements in consequence of boarding out or fostering arrangements. Section 18 is subject to section 23 of the Act.
Section 23(1) of the Act enables the Scottish Ministers to make regulations providing that an application may not be made under section 18 if the person who carried out the abuse was of a specified description, if the abuse was carried out in circumstances of a specified description, if the person who was abused came to be resident in the relevant care setting concerned in specified circumstances, or if the person who was abused was resident in the relevant care setting concerned for a specified purpose.
These Regulations make provision under section 23 of the Act for the purpose of creating exceptions to eligibility to apply for a redress payment under section 18 of the Act.
Regulation 2 makes provision for an exception where a person was placed in a relevant care setting for the purpose of being provided with short-term respite or holiday under arrangements made between a parent or guardian of that person and another person.
Impact assessments have been prepared in relation to the Act and instruments under it and will be published online at www.gov.scot.","{'category': 'Exclusively or primarily applies to Scotland', 'country': 'Scotland', 'file': 'The Redress for Survivors (Historical Child Abuse in Care) (Exceptions to Eligibility) (Scotland) Regulations 2021.txt', 'legislation': 'Scottish Statutory Instruments', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2021/413/note/made', 'year': '2021'}","EXPLANATORY NOTE

Scotland,"A retailer in Scotland is considering selling alcohol below the minimum unit price due to competitive pressures. They want to know the legal implications. Under the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012, what are the retailer's obligations, and what penalties could they face for non-compliance? ","Under the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012, which amends the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, retailers in Scotland are required to sell alcohol at or above a minimum unit price (MPU) set by the Scottish Ministers. This rule applies to all licensed premises, including shops, bars, restaurants, and temporary events with occasional licenses. The minimum price condition is detailed in Schedule 3, Paragraph 6A for premises licenses and Schedule 4, Paragraph 5A for occasional licenses. Alcohol must be sold at a minimum price calculated by multiplying the MPU by the strength and volume of the alcohol. As amended by The Alcohol (Minimum Price per Unit) (Scotland) Order 2018, the current MPU is set at 65 pence per unit. Retailers must comply with this minimum price, and selling alcohol below this threshold constitutes a breach of licensing conditions. If a retailer fails to meet the minimum pricing requirement, Section 36 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 allows the licensing board to review the premises license and impose penalties as needed. Following a review, the board may suspend the license temporarily, revoke the license entirely, or modify the license conditions to enforce compliance. These penalties aim to uphold public health and ensure responsible alcohol sales.","The retailer in Scotland is considering selling alcohol below the minimum unit price due to competitive pressures. The main legal implications of this action can be found under the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012.

1. Obligations:
   - Under the Act, retailers must not sell alcohol at a price that allows the unit price per drink to fall below £4.25 per unit (£3.25 for spirits). This means that if selling prices drop below this level, the retailer should adjust their pricing accordingly.
   - Retailers are required to have a plan in place for how they intend to comply with the minimum unit pricing (MUP) of alcohol.

2. Penalties:
   - Failure to comply with the MUP will result in an administrative penalty of up to £1 million, with the potential for further penalties if non-compliance continues.
   - Repeated failure to comply may lead to prosecution under the Licensing Act 2003 and/or the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005.

It is essential for retailers to be aware that selling alcohol below the minimum unit price can result in significant fines. They should have a plan in place to ensure compliance with this requirement.","['', ' Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, Schedule 3, Paragraph 6A ', ' Premises Licence Mandatory Conditions\r\n', ' Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, Schedule 4, Paragraph 5A ', ' Occasional Licence Mandatory Conditions\r\n', ' The Alcohol (Minimum Price per Unit) (Scotland) Order 2018 ', ' Minimum Unit Pricing for Alcohol in Scotland\r\n', ' Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, Section 36 ', ' Application for Review of Premises Licence:']",23,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Scotland,"A parent in Scotland believes their child requires additional support in school due to a learning difficulty. Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 (as amended), what rights does the child have, and what steps can the parent take to secure the necessary support?","Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004, as amended, children in Scotland who require additional support due to learning difficulties are legally entitled to specific rights. Education authorities have a duty to assess and provide for these needs when required. According to Section 8(1), if a parent requests an assessment to determine whether their child has additional support needs or requires a Co-ordinated Support Plan (CSP), the education authority must comply with this request unless it is deemed unreasonable. Following assessment, Section 4(1)(a) requires the education authority to make adequate and efficient provision for the identified needs, which can include specialized resources or tailored teaching approaches. If a child’s support needs involve multiple agencies, such as social work or healthcare in addition to education, Section 9(1) ensures they are entitled to a CSP, a document outlining coordinated support across agencies. Parents also have the right, under Section 12(2), to be actively involved in developing and reviewing support plans to ensure that their child’s educational requirements are fully understood and addressed. If disagreements arise regarding the support provided or decisions made, Section 18(1) grants parents the right to appeal to the Additional Support Needs Tribunal for Scotland, which can make binding rulings on disputes related to additional support. These legislative provisions provide a strong framework for ensuring children’s educational needs are met and give parents a clear process to advocate for the support their child requires.","Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 (as amended), a child with a learning difficulty in Scotland has several rights:

1. **Right to an Education Plan**: The child is entitled to a personalized education plan that outlines their needs, goals, and the support required to help them achieve those goals.
2. **Right to Additional Support**: The child is entitled to additional support from the school or local authority to help them access the curriculum and participate in learning activities.

To secure the necessary support for your child, you can take the following steps:

1. **Request an Education Report**: Request a detailed report on your child's education needs, including any additional support required.
2. **Meet with the School or Local Authority**: Schedule a meeting with the school or local authority to discuss your child's needs and proposed support.
3. **Seek Support from Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or Parent Council**: Many schools have a PTA or parent council that can provide guidance, advocacy, and support for parents navigating the system.
4. **Contact the Local Authority's Additional Support Team**: The local authority has a dedicated team responsible for providing additional support to children with learning difficulties. They can provide information on available resources and services.
5. **Involve Specialist Services**: If your child requires specialized services, such as speech therapy or occupational therapy, you can request that these services be provided through the school or local authority.

It's essential to work collaboratively with the school, local authority, and any relevant specialists to ensure your child receives the necessary support to succeed in school.",['Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004'],23,False,"Provision of advocacy services

NothernIreland,"An individual in NothernIreland is experiencing domestic abuse and seeks protection from their abuser. Under the Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (NothernIreland) 2021, what legal protections are available, and what steps should they take to secure those protections?","An individual in NothernIreland experiencing domestic abuse is protected under the Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (NothernIreland) 2021. Specifically, Section 1 of the Act criminalizes a course of abusive behaviour towards a person to whom the abuser is personally connected, such as a partner, ex-partner, or family member. The individual should report the abuse to the Police Service of NothernIreland to initiate a criminal investigation under this Act. Section 2 defines ""abusive behaviour"" as behaviour that is violent or threatening, or behaviour where a reasonable person would consider the course of behaviour likely to cause one or more of the following effects on the victim (B):
                                       * Making B dependent on, or subordinate to, A (the abuser);
                                       * Isolating B from friends, relatives, or other sources of social interaction or support;
                                       * Controlling, regulating, or monitoring B's day-to-day activities;
                                       * Depriving B of, or restricting, freedom of action;
                                       * Frightening, humiliating, degrading, or punishing B.
While the Act does not provide specific protective orders, the individual may apply for a Non-Molestation Order or an Occupation Order under the Family Homes and Domestic Violence (NothernIreland) Order 1998. A Non-Molestation Order can prohibit the abuser from molesting the applicant or a relevant child, and an Occupation Order can regulate the occupation of the shared residence. Additionally, Sections 25 to 28 of the Act offer special measures in civil proceedings to support victims, such as prohibiting the abuser from cross-examining the victim in person.
To secure these protections, the individual should:
                                       1. Report the abuse to the Police Service of NothernIreland to initiate criminal proceedings under the Act.
                                       2. Seek legal advice to apply for a Non-Molestation Order or an Occupation Order through the courts.
                                       3. Utilize the special measures provided in the Act during any civil proceedings to ensure their safety and well-being.","Under the Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (NothernIreland) 2021, an individual experiencing domestic abuse in NothernIreland has several legal protections available to them. Here are some of the key protections and steps they can take:

**Legal Protections:**

1. **Domestic Abuse Protection Order**: A court may issue a Domestic Abuse Protection Order (DAPO), which requires the abuser to stop the abusive behavior and provides various restrictions, such as prohibiting contact, entering certain premises, or evicting the victim from their home.
2. **Restraining Orders**: A court can also issue a restraining order, which prohibits the abuser from contacting the victim or approaching them within a specified distance.

**Steps to Secure Protections:**

1. **Contact the Police**: The individual should report the abuse to the police and seek assistance. The police will provide guidance on the next steps and help the victim apply for a DAPO.
2. **Seek a DAPO**: If the individual wants to obtain a DAPO, they should contact their local Family Court or Magistrates' Court in NothernIreland. They can also be represented by a solicitor or barrister.
3. **Provide Evidence**: To obtain a DAPO, the individual will need to provide evidence of the abuse, such as witness statements, text messages, emails, or photographs.
4. **Attend a Hearing**: A court hearing will be held to determine whether a DAPO should be granted. The abuser may also have the opportunity to present their side of the case.
5. **Monitor Compliance**: Once a DAPO is in place, the individual can monitor compliance by reporting any breaches to the police or court.

**Additional Support:**

1. **Support Organizations**: The individual can reach out to support organizations, such as domestic abuse charities or counseling services, for emotional and practical support.
2. **Counseling Services**: Counseling services can provide a safe space for the individual to process their experiences and develop coping strategies.
3. **Online Resources**: Online resources, such as the NothernIreland Domestic Abuse Helpline (0808 801 0321), can offer guidance, support, and information on available resources.

It's essential to remember that domestic abuse is never the victim's fault, and they have the right to seek protection and support.","['', ' Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (NothernIreland) 2021\r\n', ' Family Homes and Domestic Violence (NothernIreland) Order 1998']",23,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

These Rules amend the Family Procedure Rules 2010 (“the FPR”) (S.I. 2010/2955).
Rules 3 to 6 insert provisions into Part 3A of the FPR as required by section 63 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 (c. 17). The amendments automatically deem victims of domestic abuse as “vulnerable” for the purposes of determining whether a participation direction should be made. The court will therefore not need to make a determination as to vulnerability for parties or witnesses who state that they are, or are at risk of being, victims of domestic abuse before proceeding to consider which measures (if any) are necessary as a result of that vulnerability. The amendments also insert relevant statutory definitions from the Domestic Abuse Act 2021.
Rules 7 and 8 amend Part 10 of the FPR to clarify that the court may direct a means of service, other than personal service, of an application or order under Part 4 of the Family Law Act 1996 (c. 27).
Rule 9 amends rule 10.10 of the FPR to clarify that the court officer must notify the police of certain orders made under Part 4 of the Family Law Act 1996 where the court is to effect service of such an order in accordance with rule 10.6(2) of the FPR.

Sections 65 and 66 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 (c. 17) introduce new Part 4A into the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 and new Part 7A into the Courts Act 2003, respectively. Those provisions operate in family and civil proceedings to prohibit cross-examination in person between a party and a witness in defined circumstances, including where there is evidence of domestic abuse between them. The prohibition will apply automatically where there has been a conviction, charge (applicable in family proceedings only) or caution for a specified offence, where an on-notice protective injunction is in force between the party and witness or where there is other specified evidence of domestic abuse.
These Regulations specify the types of offences, protective injunctions and forms of evidence which will trigger the automatic prohibition of cross-examination in person between the party and witness.
Regulation 2 introduces Schedule 1 to the Regulations which contains a list of the specified offences, under the law of England and Wales (table 1), Scotland (table 2) and Northern Ireland (table 3).
Regulation 3 introduces Schedule 2 to the Regulations which contains a list of the specified protective injunctions, orders and interdicts under the law of England and Wales (table 1), Scotland (table 2) and Northern Ireland (table 3).

NothernIreland,"An employee in NothernIreland suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage. Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015, what are their rights, and what steps can they take to address the issue?","Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015, an employee in NothernIreland who suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage (NMW) has specific rights and actionable steps to address the issue. The Act mandates that employees must be paid at least the NMW, as set out in Section 1(1), which establishes the legal entitlement to minimum wage for all qualifying workers. Employers are legally required to keep accurate records of wage payments under Section 9 of the Act. These records should be sufficient to demonstrate that an employee is being paid at least the NMW. Therefore, the first step for the employee is to review their pay records to confirm any potential underpayment. Should there be a discrepancy, Section 10 grants the employee the right to formally request access to these records, enabling them to verify their calculations against the NMW requirement. If the employee identifies an underpayment, they should raise this issue with their employer, as it may be an oversight. If the employer fails to resolve the issue, the employee can escalate the matter to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the body responsible for enforcing compliance. While Section 13 of the Act authorizes the Secretary of State to appoint officers for enforcement purposes, Section 14 provides HMRC officers with the power to issue enforcement notices if employers are found non-compliant.  While the Act provides the primary framework, the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015 offer additional details for specific situations, such as valuing accommodation benefits or adjusting for absences, which can influence wage calculations. For most straightforward underpayment cases, the Act alone provides the necessary rights and procedures, with the Regulations supporting only in specific circumstances affecting wage calculation. In addition to these provisions, the Employment Rights (NothernIreland) Order 1996 is also relevant as it grants the employee a procedural framework for seeking redress if they are not compensated as per the NMW. Under the 1996 Order, if an employee experiences a sustained issue with underpayment, they have the right to file a claim with an Industrial Tribunal. This Order, though not specifically addressing minimum wage rates, is essential for the employee’s right to fair wages, as it permits claims for unlawful deduction of wages or breach of contract, allowing the employee to recover underpaid amounts. The 1996 Order thus complements the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 by establishing legal recourse in cases of wage disputes.","Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015, if an employee in NothernIreland suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage, their rights include:

1. The right to receive the correct rate of pay: According to regulation 4 of the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015, employees who work for less than 40 hours per week must be paid at least £8.91 per hour for workers aged 23 and over.
2. The right to claim back underpaid wages: Employees who have been underpaid can claim back the difference from their employer.

To address the issue, the employee can take the following steps:

1. Check pay records: Review their pay records to ensure they are receiving the correct rate of pay.
2. Document underpayment: Keep a record of all instances of underpayment, including dates and amounts.
3. Speak to manager or HR: Schedule a meeting with their manager or HR representative to discuss their concerns about underpayment.
4. File a complaint: If speaking to management does not resolve the issue, the employee can file a complaint with the NothernIreland Department for Communities, Equality, and Social Inclusion (DfCIEI) or the NothernIreland Labour Court.
5. Seek advice from an employment rights organization: The employee may want to seek advice from an organization such as the NothernIreland Disability and Learning Difficulty Service or the NothernIreland Law Centre.

It's essential for employees to understand their rights under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015 to ensure they receive fair treatment and adequate compensation for their work.","['', ' National Minimum Wage Act 1998\r\n', ' National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015\r\n', ' The Employment Rights (NothernIreland) Order 1996']",23,False,"2.

These Regulations amend the National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/621) (“the 2015 Regulations”) and come into force on 1st April 2024.
Regulation 57(1) of the 2015 Regulations provides that the term “work” within those Regulations does not include any work done in relation to an employer’s family household if the requirements set out in regulation 57(2) or (3) are met. These Regulations remove regulation 57(3) of the 2015 Regulations (“paragraph (3)”). The requirements set out in paragraph (3) are all of the following—
(a)
the worker resides in the family home of the worker’s employer;
(b)
the worker is not a member of that family, but is treated as such, in particular as regards to the provision of living accommodation and meals and the sharing of tasks and leisure activities;
(c)
the worker is neither liable to any deduction, nor to make any payment to the employer, or any other person, as respects the provision of the living accommodation or meals;
(d)
if the work had been done by a member of the employer’s family, it would not be treated as work or as performed under a worker’s contract because the requirements in regulation 57(2) would be met. The requirements in regulation 57(2) are all of the following: the worker is a member of the employer’s family; the worker resides in the family home of the employer; the worker shares in the tasks and activities of the family.
Upon commencement of this instrument, any work which meets the requirements set out in paragraph (3) will be included as “work” for the purposes of the 2015 Regulations. This will mean that from 1st April 2024 a worker must be remunerated in respect of any such work in a pay reference period (as defined by regulation 6 of the 2015 Regulations) at a rate which is not less than the national minimum wage (as set out in Part 2 of the 2015 Regulations).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. Instead a de minimis assessment has been prepared as this instrument is likely to entail some costs for businesses, but the net impact is estimated to be below £5 million per year.","{'category': 'May contain legislation that applies to NothernIreland', 'country': 'NothernIreland', 'file': 'The National Minimum Wage (Amendment) Regulations 2024.txt', 'legislation': 'UK Statutory Instruments', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2024/75/note/made', 'year': '2024'}","EXPLANATORY NOTE

NothernIreland,"An employee in NothernIreland has recently lost a child and is unsure about their entitlement to bereavement leave and pay. Under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022, what are their rights, and how can they access them?","Under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022, an employee in NothernIreland who has recently lost a child is entitled to bereavement leave, and if they meet certain criteria, they may also be eligible for bereavement pay. Article 112EA(1)-(3) defines a ""bereaved parent"" as an employee who meets specified relationship conditions with the deceased child, which may include a caregiving role before the child’s death. Employees who lose a child under 18, or experience a stillbirth after 24 weeks of pregnancy, are entitled to at least two weeks of bereavement leave under Article 112EA(5). This leave can be taken either as a single two-week block or in two separate one-week periods. According to Article 112EA(6), this leave must be taken within at least 56 days (eight weeks) from the date of the child’s death, providing flexibility within that period.
If an employee loses more than one child, Article 112EA(7) entitles them to bereavement leave for each child. Article 112EB outlines rights during and after bereavement leave, specifying that employees on leave retain most employment terms and conditions (excluding remuneration). According to Article 112EB(1)(a)-(c), employees are entitled to return to their original or an equivalent job after bereavement leave. Furthermore, Article 112EB(3) provides that if bereavement leave coincides with other types of parental leave (such as maternity or paternity leave), the right to return applies across the entire period of absence.
To access bereavement leave, Article 112ED(a) requires employees to notify their employer as soon as reasonably practicable, specifying the intended dates for leave. Employers are obligated to grant this leave and cannot delay or refuse it. If the employee is also eligible for statutory bereavement pay, they must provide notice and any required documentation as directed under Articles 112ED(a) and (c).","Under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022, the employee's rights include:

1. Entitlement to parental bereavement leave: The employee is entitled to take up to two weeks' leave from their job within the 56 weeks following the death of a child.
2. Notice requirements: The employee must provide notice to their employer before taking parental bereavement leave, but they do not need to provide written notice.
3. Options for leave duration: The employee has the option to take either one or two weeks' parental bereavement leave.
4. Availability of leave: The employee can take parental bereavement leave within the period of 56 weeks beginning with the date of the child's death.
5. Protection from detriment and dismissal: The employee is protected from being dismissed or made to face detriment (such as reduction in pay or benefits) for taking or seeking parental bereavement leave.

To access their rights, the employee should:

1. Notify their employer in writing: Although not mandatory, providing written notice will help the employer understand the expected duration of the leave.
2. Take notice of the company's policies: The employee should be aware of their company's specific policies and procedures regarding parental bereavement leave.
3. Speak with HR or management: If the employee is unsure about any aspect of their entitlement, they can discuss it with their HR department or management team.
4. Review the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations 2022: The employee can access a copy of the regulations online or through the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Labour Market Directorate.

By following these steps, the employee can ensure that they receive the bereavement leave and pay they are entitled to under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022.","['', ' Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022']",23,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers inserted into the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 (N.I. 16) (the “1996 Order”) by the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 (c. 5).
The Regulations revoke and re-enact the provisions of the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023 which would otherwise cease to have effect by virtue of Article 251(1A) of the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996.
These Regulations provide for a statutory entitlement for bereaved parents who are employees to take up to two weeks’ leave from their job called parental bereavement leave in the 56 weeks following the death of a child.
Part 2 relates to entitlement to parental bereavement leave. The right to take parental bereavement leave is conferred by regulation 4 which sets out the conditions for entitlement which must be satisfied by the employee in order to take parental bereavement leave. These include substantive requirements, such as the employee falling within the definition of a bereaved parent (in particular, specifying the types of parental relationships in respect of which the new entitlement arises), as well as procedural requirements, such as the employee giving appropriate notices to their employer. Where an employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave under regulation 4 as the result of the death of more than one child, the employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave in respect of each child.
Regulation 5 sets out the number of weeks of parental bereavement leave that are available to a bereaved parent and gives an employee the option of taking either one or two weeks’ parental bereavement leave. The weeks taken as parental bereavement leave do not need to be taken consecutively. It also provides that parental bereavement leave may only be taken within the period of 56 weeks beginning with the date of the child’s death.
Regulation 6 details the notice requirements and other information the bereaved parent must provide to their employer before taking parental bereavement leave. An employee does not need to provide notice in writing to his or her employer, but the length of notice required to book and cancel parental bereavement leave will vary depending on whether the period the employee intends to take as parental bereavement leave falls within 56 days of the child’s death or later. Regulations 7 and 8 respectively set out when an employee’s period of bereavement leave may start and what happens when a period of parental bereavement leave is interrupted by another type of statutory leave under Part 9 of the 1996 Order.
Part 3 contains provisions applicable in relation to the taking of parental bereavement leave. Regulation 9 elaborates on the new Article 112EB of the 1996 Order, by providing that an employee is entitled during his or her absence on leave to the benefit of all of his or her terms and conditions of employment apart from the right to remuneration (excluded by Article 112EB(2)(b)); also that the employee is subject to all of the obligations under those terms and conditions except in so far as they are inconsistent with the right to take parental bereavement leave (the exception appears in Article 112EB(1)(b)). Regulations 10 and 11 provide for an employee’s right to return to work after taking a period of parental bereavement leave, distinguishing the case where the leave was an isolated period of absence from the case where it followed another period of statutory leave. Regulations 12 and 13 provide that an employee entitled to parental bereavement leave is protected from detriment and dismissal attributable to the fact that they took or sought to take parental bereavement leave.
Part 4 contains provisions applicable where an employee has a contractual right to parental bereavement leave, in addition to the statutory right contained within these Regulations.
Part 5 (regulations 16 to 22) contains provisions in respect of the Transitional arrangements that will ensure a continuity of entitlement between the revoked Regulations and current Regulations. This part also contains the revocation of the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023.
A separate impact assessment has not been prepared for these Regulations. The Regulations are part of a package of legislative measures and the relevant impact assessment is the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill impact assessment which was published in April 2020.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations introduce a new statutory entitlement for bereaved parents who are employees to take up to two weeks’ leave from their job called parental bereavement leave in the 56 weeks following the death of a child. These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers inserted into the Employment Rights Act 1996 (c. 18) (the “1996 Act”) by the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay Act) 2018 (c. 24).
Part 2 relates to entitlement to parental bereavement leave. The right to take parental bereavement leave is conferred by regulation 4 which sets out the conditions for entitlement which must be satisfied by the employee in order to take parental bereavement leave. These include substantive requirements, such as the employee falling within the definition of a bereaved parent (in particular, specifying the types of parental relationships in respect of which the new entitlement arises), as well as procedural requirements, such as the employee giving appropriate notices to their employer. Where an employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave under regulation 4 as the result of the death of more than one child, the employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave in respect of each child.
Regulation 5 sets out the number of weeks of parental bereavement leave that are available to a bereaved parent and gives an employee the option of taking either one or two weeks’ parental bereavement leave. The weeks taken as parental bereavement leave do not need to be taken consecutively. It also provides that parental bereavement leave may only be taken within the period of 56 weeks beginning with the date of the child’s death.
Regulation 6 details the notice requirements and other information the bereaved parent must provide to their employer before taking parental bereavement leave. An employee does not need to provide notice in writing to his or her employer, but the length of notice required to book and cancel parental bereavement leave will vary depending on whether the period the employee intends to take as parental bereavement leave falls within 56 days of the child’s death or later. Regulations 7 and 8 respectively set out when an employee’s period of bereavement leave may start and what happens when a period of parental bereavement leave is interrupted by another type of statutory leave under Part 8 of the 1996 Act.
Part 3 contains provisions applicable in relation to the taking of parental bereavement leave. Regulation 9 elaborates on the new section 80EB of the 1996 Act, by providing that an employee is entitled during his or her absence on leave to the benefit of all of his or her terms and conditions of employment apart from the right to remuneration (excluded by Section 80EB(3)(b)); also that the employee is subject to all of the obligations under those terms and conditions except in so far as they are inconsistent with the right to take parental bereavement leave (the exception appears in section 80EB(1)(b)). Regulations 10 and 11 provide for an employee’s right to return to work after taking a period of parental bereavement leave, distinguishing the case where the leave was an isolated period of absence from the case where it followed another period of statutory leave. Regulations 12 and 13 provide that an employee entitled to parental bereavement leave is protected from detriment and dismissal attributable to the fact that they took or sought to take parental bereavement leave.
Part 4 contains provisions applicable where an employee has a contractual right to parental bereavement leave, in addition to the statutory right contained within these Regulations.
These Regulations are part of a package of legislative measures and the relevant impact assessment is the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill impact assessment which was published on 14 May 2018. A copy of that impact assessment can be obtained from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Labour Market Directorate, 1 Victoria Street, London, SW1H 0ET.","{'category': 'May contain legislation that applies to NothernIreland', 'country': 'NothernIreland', 'file': 'The Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations 2020.txt', 'legislation': 'UK Statutory Instruments', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/249/note/made', 'year': '2020'}"
NothernIreland,"A tenant in NothernIreland has been served an eviction notice by their landlord, giving them four weeks to vacate the property. The tenant has lived there for two years under a periodic tenancy. Under the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, is the notice period valid, and what rights does the tenant have?","Under the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, a landlord’s notice to quit a property must meet specific statutory notice periods based on the length of the tenancy. This Act amends the Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006, particularly Article 14, to reflect updated notice requirements. For a tenant who has lived in the property for two years under a periodic tenancy, Section 11 of the 2022 Act amends Article 14 of the 2006 Order to specify that the landlord must provide at least 4 months’ notice before requiring the tenant to vacate. This 4-month period applies to tenancies that have existed for more than 12 months but not more than 3 years (as outlined in the new Article 14(1A)(b)). Because the landlord provided only four weeks’ notice, this does not satisfy the legal requirement, rendering the notice invalid. The tenant has the right to remain in the property until a valid notice to quit is served that meets the legally required notice period. Under Section 11 of the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, which amends Article 14 of the Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006, landlords are required to give a minimum 4-month notice for tenancies that have lasted more than 12 months but not more than 3 years. Because the tenant has lived in the property for two years, the landlord’s four-week notice does not meet this requirement and is therefore invalid. The tenant may choose to inform the landlord in writing that the notice is invalid due to the insufficient notice period, referencing Article 14(1), which states that a notice to quit is only valid if it complies with the minimum notice periods required by law. If the landlord proceeds with eviction attempts despite the invalid notice, the tenant may seek legal remedies. While specific injunctions or protections against harassment are not outlined within this tenancy legislation, the tenant may still seek legal assistance through broader NothernIreland housing or civil law protections to prevent an unlawful eviction and maintain peaceful possession of the property.","Under the Private Tenancies (Northern Ireland) Order 2006, as amended by the Private Tenancies (Northern Ireland) Order 2022, the minimum notice period for an eviction notice is four weeks. In this case, the landlord has served a valid four-week notice to quit.

However, since the tenant has lived in the property under a periodic tenancy for two years, they may be entitled to protection from forced eviction under the Rent Act 1977 (as amended by the Coronavirus Act 2020). The prescribed information in the Notice to Quit etc. (Prescribed Information) Regulations 1988 requires that the landlord must specify whether the notice is being given less than six months before the date on which it is to take effect, and if so, on what grounds.

In this case, since the tenant has been served a four-week notice, we need to check if the landlord has provided the prescribed information. According to section 16 of the Regulations, where less than six months' notice has been given, the landlord must specify that the notice is being given ""on the basis that the circumstance specified in Case 2 in Schedule 15 to the Rent Act 1977 applies"" (conduct which is a nuisance or annoyance to adjoining occupiers, or dwelling-houses used for immoral or illegal purposes).

Since the tenant has not provided any information on this matter, it appears that the landlord may not have fulfilled the prescribed requirements. Therefore, the tenant may be able to challenge the validity of the eviction notice and seek protection from forced eviction under the Rent Act 1977.

Additionally, the tenant should also be aware of their rights under the Coronavirus Act 2020, which provides additional protections for tenants during the pandemic. The Regulations may provide further guidance on the grounds for termination and the notice period in exceptional circumstances.

It is recommended that the tenant seeks advice from a housing lawyer or a relevant authority to determine their specific rights and options under Northern Irish law.","['', ' Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022 ', ' Section 11\r\n', ' Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006 ', ' Article 14']",23,False,"Notice to quit: private tenancies

(This note is not part of the regulations)
These Regulations amend the Private Tenancies (Coronavirus Modifications) Act (Northern Ireland) 2020 and extend the emergency period to 31 March 2021.
These Regulations are made in response to the continuing threat to public health which is posed by the incidence and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) in Northern Ireland and in consideration of the rates of transmission increasing since the beginning of July 2020. As many of the economic support packages such as the Furlough scheme are due to wind down in the autumn, there is potential for a rise in unemployment which may impact private renters’ income streams and place them at increased risk of losing their homes.
These Regulations protect tenants from eviction for a reasonable and specified period of time and provide that landlords must give their tenants at least 12 weeks’ notice to quit a dwelling house let under a private tenancy.","{'category': 'Exclusively or primarily applies to NothernIreland', 'country': 'NothernIreland', 'file': 'The Private Tenancies (Coronavirus Modifications) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2020.txt', 'legislation': 'Northern Ireland Statutory Rules', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/2020/192/note/made', 'year': '2020'}","EXPLANATORY NOTE

NothernIreland,"An individual in NothernIreland is being harassed and stalked by an ex-partner, causing them significant distress. Under the Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022, what legal protections are available to them, and what steps should they take to ensure their safety?","Under the Protection from Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022, individuals in NothernIreland who are being harassed and stalked by an ex-partner can rely on specific legal protections. The Act clearly defines stalking as a criminal offense in Section 1, where engaging in a course of conduct causing another person to experience fear, alarm, or substantial distress constitutes stalking. Such conduct includes following, contacting, monitoring usage of electronic communications, and other invasive behaviors. Offenders can face severe penalties, with up to 10 years imprisonment or a fine upon conviction on indictment, or up to 12 months imprisonment or a statutory maximum fine upon summary conviction. Additionally, the Act allows for Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs), detailed in Section 7, which the Chief Constable can apply for. These orders are designed to prevent further stalking activities by imposing specific prohibitions or requirements on the stalker. The eligibility for an SPO is based on evidence that the individual has engaged in stalking, poses a risk related to stalking, and that the order is necessary to protect someone from this risk. These orders can be applied against anyone residing in, or intending to visit, NothernIreland. The duration of these orders is addressed in Section 9, where an SPO can last for a minimum of two years or until further court order. The court may specify that some conditions within the SPO remain effective until further judicial review while setting others for fixed periods. This flexibility allows the protective measures to be adapted over time to match the needs of the situation. For their safety, affected individuals should report stalking incidents to the Police Service of NothernIreland (PSNI), enabling legal proceedings that could include the issuance of an SPO. Consulting legal advice and engaging with support services are also advisable steps to ensure comprehensive protection and support.","Under the Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, the individual can seek various legal protections against the ex-partner's harassment and stalking. Here are some of the key provisions:

1. **Protection Order**: The individual can apply for a Protection Order, which is a court order that prohibits the ex-partner from contacting or approaching them. The Protection Order can also include other conditions, such as requiring the ex-partner to stay away from specific locations.
2. **Injunctions**: In addition to a Protection Order, the individual may be able to obtain injunctions to prevent specific behaviors by the ex-partner, such as following them or contacting their workplace.
3. **Restraining Orders**: The individual can also apply for Restraining Orders, which are similar to Protection Orders but may have more severe consequences for those who breach them.

To ensure their safety, the individual should take the following steps:

1. **Document everything**: Keep a record of all incidents of harassment and stalking, including dates, times, locations, and details of what happened.
2. **Contact the police**: Report all incidents to the police immediately, even if they are minor. This will help build a case against the ex-partner.
3. **Seek support**: Reach out to friends, family, or a counselor for emotional support. They can also contact organizations that specialize in supporting victims of domestic abuse and stalking.
4. **Change your routine**: Avoiding predictable patterns and routines can make it harder for the ex-partner to track you down.
5. **Use technology wisely**: Use technology to stay safe, such as blocking the ex-partner's phone number or social media accounts.
6. **Apply for a Protection Order**: If possible, apply for a Protection Order as soon as possible.

It's essential to remember that stalking is a serious crime in Northern Ireland, and the law takes it very seriously. The individual should not try to confront the ex-partner directly but instead focus on protecting themselves through legal means.
