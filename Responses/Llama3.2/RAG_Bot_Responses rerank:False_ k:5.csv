Unitedkingdom,"An employee in England is currently on maternity leave under the Employment Rights Act 1996. During her leave, her employer announces a redundancy process due to company restructuring. Additionally, there are health and safety concerns at the workplace that might affect her return. Considering the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (as amended), the Equality Act 2010, the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, and relevant case law, what protections does she have during redundancy, and how should the employer proceed?","Under the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999, specifically Regulation 10, if an employee on maternity leave is at risk of redundancy, she must be offered any suitable alternative vacancy available before it is offered to other employees, giving her priority for redeployment opportunities. The Equality Act 2010, particularly Section 18, prohibits discrimination because of pregnancy or maternity, requiring employers to ensure that redundancy selection criteria do not disadvantage employees on maternity leave to avoid unlawful discrimination claims. Regarding health and safety, the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, Regulation 16, mandates employers to perform a specific risk assessment for new or expectant mothers, and if risks are identified and cannot be avoided, the employer must adjust her working conditions or hours, offer suitable alternative work on no less favorable terms, or if no alternative is available, suspend her on full pay. Relevant case law, such as Sefton Borough Council v Wainwright [2014] EWCA Civ 953, confirms the obligation to offer suitable alternative employment to employees on maternity leave before others. Therefore, the employer must conduct a fair and non-discriminatory redundancy process, prioritize the employee for any suitable alternative positions, and address health and safety concerns by performing risk assessments and taking necessary actions to protect the employee.","The employee in question is facing a complex situation with overlapping employment rights and regulations. To address her concerns, let's break down the applicable laws and regulations:

1. **Maternity Leave under Employment Rights Act 1996**: As she's on maternity leave, she has statutory rights to protect her from unfair dismissal and detriment during her leave.

2. **Parental Bereavement Leave**: Although not directly relevant, this regulation does provide for a period of leave following the death of a child, which might have implications if there were other reasons for taking an extended absence due to family circumstances.

3. **Equality Act 2010**: The Equality Act protects employees from unfair treatment based on various grounds including pregnancy, maternity, and caring responsibilities. However, it does not specifically address redundancy or health and safety concerns directly in relation to these rights.

4. **Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999**: These regulations require employers to take measures to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of employees. In cases where an employee's health is affected by working conditions, the employer may be required to provide a safe working environment or adjust duties accordingly.

5. **Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (as amended)**: These regulations specify how maternity leave can be taken, including any notice periods and continuation of pay. They do not directly address redundancy but offer guidance on maternity leave arrangements.

Given these points:

- The employee has a right to protection against unfair dismissal during her maternity leave under the Employment Rights Act 1996.
- Given the health and safety concerns and the redundancy process, it's crucial for the employer to prioritize her safety. This might involve temporary transfer to a safe job role or suspension without loss of pay if possible.
- The Equality Act does not directly offer protection against redundancy but does ensure that any reduction in force is fair and does not discriminate on grounds protected by the Act.

**Employer Action**:

1. **Communicate Openly**: Ensure the employee understands her rights, options for continuing work safely, or exploring alternative roles within the company.
2. **Health and Safety Assessment**: Conduct a thorough assessment to identify potential health risks associated with returning to work and implement necessary safety measures.
3. **Temporary Transfer or Suspension**: Offer a temporary transfer to a safer role if possible, or consider suspending her from work without loss of pay until the situation improves.
4. **Fair Procedure**: Ensure that any decision regarding redundancy is fair, considering all relevant factors including her health and maternity leave status.
5. **Legal Advice**: If unsure about how to proceed, advise seeking legal counsel who specializes in employment law.

**Employee Rights**:

- She has a right to protection from unfair dismissal during her maternity leave.
- Any redundancy decision must be made fairly without discrimination.
- She should seek advice on any potential health and safety concerns that could impact her ability to return to work safely.

This situation requires careful balance between ensuring the employee's job security, her right to return to work in a safe environment, and adherence to employment laws protecting pregnant women and new mothers.","['', ' Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999, Regulation 10\r\n', ' Equality Act 2010, Section 18\r\n', ' Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, Regulation 16']",5,False,"Protection from detriment

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers inserted into the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 (N.I. 16) (the “1996 Order”) by the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 (c. 5).
The Regulations revoke and re-enact the provisions of the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023 which would otherwise cease to have effect by virtue of Article 251(1A) of the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996.
These Regulations provide for a statutory entitlement for bereaved parents who are employees to take up to two weeks’ leave from their job called parental bereavement leave in the 56 weeks following the death of a child.
Part 2 relates to entitlement to parental bereavement leave. The right to take parental bereavement leave is conferred by regulation 4 which sets out the conditions for entitlement which must be satisfied by the employee in order to take parental bereavement leave. These include substantive requirements, such as the employee falling within the definition of a bereaved parent (in particular, specifying the types of parental relationships in respect of which the new entitlement arises), as well as procedural requirements, such as the employee giving appropriate notices to their employer. Where an employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave under regulation 4 as the result of the death of more than one child, the employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave in respect of each child.
Regulation 5 sets out the number of weeks of parental bereavement leave that are available to a bereaved parent and gives an employee the option of taking either one or two weeks’ parental bereavement leave. The weeks taken as parental bereavement leave do not need to be taken consecutively. It also provides that parental bereavement leave may only be taken within the period of 56 weeks beginning with the date of the child’s death.
Regulation 6 details the notice requirements and other information the bereaved parent must provide to their employer before taking parental bereavement leave. An employee does not need to provide notice in writing to his or her employer, but the length of notice required to book and cancel parental bereavement leave will vary depending on whether the period the employee intends to take as parental bereavement leave falls within 56 days of the child’s death or later. Regulations 7 and 8 respectively set out when an employee’s period of bereavement leave may start and what happens when a period of parental bereavement leave is interrupted by another type of statutory leave under Part 9 of the 1996 Order.
Part 3 contains provisions applicable in relation to the taking of parental bereavement leave. Regulation 9 elaborates on the new Article 112EB of the 1996 Order, by providing that an employee is entitled during his or her absence on leave to the benefit of all of his or her terms and conditions of employment apart from the right to remuneration (excluded by Article 112EB(2)(b)); also that the employee is subject to all of the obligations under those terms and conditions except in so far as they are inconsistent with the right to take parental bereavement leave (the exception appears in Article 112EB(1)(b)). Regulations 10 and 11 provide for an employee’s right to return to work after taking a period of parental bereavement leave, distinguishing the case where the leave was an isolated period of absence from the case where it followed another period of statutory leave. Regulations 12 and 13 provide that an employee entitled to parental bereavement leave is protected from detriment and dismissal attributable to the fact that they took or sought to take parental bereavement leave.
Part 4 contains provisions applicable where an employee has a contractual right to parental bereavement leave, in addition to the statutory right contained within these Regulations.
Part 5 (regulations 16 to 22) contains provisions in respect of the Transitional arrangements that will ensure a continuity of entitlement between the revoked Regulations and current Regulations. This part also contains the revocation of the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023.
A separate impact assessment has not been prepared for these Regulations. The Regulations are part of a package of legislative measures and the relevant impact assessment is the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill impact assessment which was published in April 2020.

Unitedkingdom,"A tenant in England reports a malfunctioning carbon monoxide alarm installed under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (Amendment) Regulations 2022. Despite notifying the landlord, the alarm has not been repaired or replaced after three weeks. The tenant is concerned about safety and compliance. Under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm Regulations 2015 (as amended), what are the landlord's legal obligations, and what actions can the tenant take?","Under Regulation 6 of the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015, when a landlord is served with a remedial notice for breaching one or more duties outlined in Regulation 4(1) (such as failing to install or maintain smoke or carbon monoxide alarms), the landlord must take the specified remedial actions within the timeframe set out in Regulation 5(2)(d), typically 28 days from the notice's issuance. This regulation imposes a clear duty on the landlord to address the breach promptly and ensures tenant safety through enforcement mechanisms. However, Regulation 6(2) provides that a landlord will not be considered in breach of this obligation if they can demonstrate that they have taken all reasonable steps, short of initiating legal proceedings, to comply with the duty. Reasonable steps may include hiring contractors, arranging access to the property, or documenting efforts to resolve tenant-related barriers to compliance. Proper evidence of these steps is crucial to establish the landlord’s diligence. This provision ensures that while landlords are held accountable, genuine efforts to comply are recognized, even if the issue remains unresolved due to circumstances beyond their control.","Under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm Regulations 2015 (as amended) in England, a landlord is legally obligated to:

1. Ensure that each dwelling house has at least one smoke alarm installed on every storey.
2. Ensure that each smoking alarm is properly maintained, including replacing it when notified of its fault or before the manufacturer's specified date of expiry.

If the tenant has not received timely repairs or replacement of the malfunctioning carbon monoxide alarm after notifying the landlord, they can take the following actions:

1. Provide written notice to the landlord requesting the repair or replacement of the alarm.
2. Seek assistance from a local housing authority or a tenant's union if the landlord fails to respond.
3. Contact the local fire service for guidance and potential intervention if there is an immediate risk to safety.

It is recommended that the tenant document all correspondence and interactions with the landlord, including dates, times, and details of conversations, as well as any evidence of the malfunctioning alarm. This will help build a strong case for seeking redress and ensuring compliance with the regulations.","['', ' Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015 – Regulation 6: Duty of Relevant Landlord to Comply with a Remedial Notice\r\n', ' Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015 – Regulation 4: Duties of Landlords\r\n', ' Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015 – Regulation 5: Remedial Notices']",5,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

As an apprentice, their wage rate should be lower than the National Minimum Wage for their age group.

Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015, an apprentice's wage must be set at a rate that is no less than £3.90 per hour (for England) or £4.00 per hour (for Scotland). This rate applies to apprentices who are under 19 years old.

Since the apprentice has completed their first year of training and has turned 19, they should be paid the National Minimum Wage for their age group, which is currently £7.70 per hour in England (or £8.20 per hour in Scotland).

If the employer is not compliant with the minimum wage requirements, the apprentice can take several steps:

1. **Check the employment contract**: The apprentice should review their employment contract to ensure that it specifies the correct wage rate for their age group.
2. **Request a pay adjustment**: The apprentice can request their employer to adjust their wages to the correct level, citing the relevant legislation and regulations.
3. **Seek advice from a trade union or apprenticeship organization**: If the apprentice is a member of a trade union or works with an apprenticeship organization, they may be able to seek guidance and support in resolving the issue.
4. **Report the non-compliance to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC)**: If the employer continues to pay the apprentice below the minimum wage rate, the apprentice can report the non-compliance to HMRC.

It is essential for apprentices to understand their rights and entitlements regarding wages and to take action if they believe their employer is not complying with the relevant legislation.","['', ' National Minimum Wage Act 1998:\r\n', ' Employment Rights Act 1996, Section 13:\r\n', ' National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015, Regulation 5(1)']",5,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Unitedkingdom,"Residents in an English town are concerned that their local authority has not implemented separate food waste collections, as required by the Environment Act 2021. The deadline has passed, and there is no plan in place. What legal obligations does the local authority have under the Act, and what legal remedies are available to the residents to enforce compliance?","Under the Environment Act 2021, specifically Section 57, which inserts Section 45AZB into the Environmental Protection Act 1990, local authorities in England are legally obligated to arrange for the separate collection of food waste from households; failure to do so constitutes a breach of statutory duty. Residents can raise the issue with the local authority by submitting formal complaints requesting compliance, engage with local councillors and Members of Parliament (MPs) to advocate for action, and may have standing to apply for a judicial review of the local authority's failure to comply with statutory duties, as established in cases like R (on the application of Greenpeace Ltd) v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1998] Env LR 415; they must act promptly and within three months of the grounds arising.","Under the Environment Act 2021, the local authority is legally obligated to implement separate food waste collections in their town.

Regulation 2 of the Environmental Targets (Residual Waste) (England) Regulations 2023 states that relevant authorities must have a system in place for collecting and processing residual waste, including food waste. However, it does not explicitly mention food waste collections as a specific requirement.

However, the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) (Amendment) (England and Wales) Regulations 2023, which came into force on January 1st, 2024 states that waste producers must ensure that their packaging waste is collected separately from other types of waste. This regulation implies that food waste should be collected separately.

To enforce compliance with the local authority's obligations under the Environment Act 2021, residents can take the following legal remedies:

1. **Contact the local authority**: Residents can contact their local authority and express their concerns about not having separate food waste collections in place. The authority must respond to these concerns and provide a plan for implementation.
2. **Submit a complaint under the Environmental Protection Act 1990**: If the residents believe that the local authority is not fulfilling its duties under the Environment Act 2021, they can submit a complaint to the Local Environment Quality Authority (LEQA) or the relevant local authority's environmental health department.
3. **Take legal action against the local authority**: If the residents believe that their rights have been breached and there are no plans for separate food waste collections in place, they may consider taking legal action against the local authority through a private prosecution or by bringing an administrative appeal under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004.
4. **Lodge a complaint with the Secretary of State**: If the residents believe that their rights have been breached and there is no effective response from the local authority, they can lodge a complaint directly with the Secretary of State for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs.

It's essential to note that these remedies may not be available immediately, as the deadline for implementation has passed. Residents should contact the local authority and the relevant authorities (LEQA or local authority) to express their concerns and seek guidance on their rights under the Environment Act 2021.","['', ' Environment Act 2021, Section 57 (inserting Section 45AZB into the Environmental Protection Act 1990)\r\n', ' Environmental Protection Act 1990, Section 45AZB (as inserted by the Environment Act 2021)']",5,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Wales,"An employee lives in Wales but works in England. They are planning to take Shared Parental Leave (SPL) following the birth of their child. They are unsure how the differences between Welsh and English regulations might affect their entitlement and whether their residence in Wales impacts their rights. Under the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, what are their rights, and does their place of residence affect their entitlement? ","Under the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, which are authorized by the Employment Rights Act 1996, an employee's entitlement to Shared Parental Leave (SPL) is determined by their employment status and specific eligibility criteria, irrespective of their place of residence. The regulations apply uniformly across England and Wales. To qualify for SPL, the employee must have been continuously employed by the same employer for at least 26 weeks by the end of the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth and remain employed at the start of each period of SPL taken. Additionally, their partner must have worked (employed or self-employed) for at least 26 of the 66 weeks before the expected week of childbirth and have earned an average of at least £30 per week in 13 of those weeks. These criteria are outlined in the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, specifically in Part 2, Chapter 1, Regulation 6. Therefore, an employee residing in Wales and working in England is entitled to SPL, provided they meet these eligibility requirements, with their place of residence having no impact on their entitlement.","I'd be happy to help you understand your rights as an employee taking Shared Parental Leave (SPL) in Wales.

Under the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, your entitlement to SPL is determined by your relevant day. The relevant day referred to in regulation 39(1B) of the Regulations is now defined as the day after a period of 18 months beginning with the day on which the child enters Great Britain.

Since you live in Wales but work in England, it's essential to consider how this might affect your entitlement. According to the updated regulations, if you're not taking maternity or adoption leave, there is a six-week threshold of continuous leave that needs to be met for the requirements to apply for a period of time after SPL has ended. Where the six-week threshold is not met, the requirements apply during SPL.

In your case, since you live in Wales but work in England, it's likely that the Welsh regulations will apply. However, the Regulations also state that the requirements can be applied during pregnancy and for a period of time after SPL has ended if an employee is on maternity or adoption leave. Since you're not taking maternity or adoption leave, your six-week threshold needs to be met before the requirements can apply.

It's worth noting that the place of residence may affect your entitlement in certain circumstances. According to the updated Regulations, for those taking shared parental leave who have not taken maternity or adoption leave, there is a requirement that the employee must reside in England and Wales for at least 26 weeks immediately preceding the start date of SPL.

However, this provision only applies if you're not already entitled to SPL based on another qualifying event. Since your specific circumstances are unclear, it's difficult to say whether this provision would apply to you. 

In summary, as an employee taking SPL in Wales but working in England, your entitlement is primarily determined by the Welsh regulations. You'll need to meet the six-week threshold of continuous leave to ensure that you're eligible for SPL during pregnancy and after SPL has ended. While your place of residence may affect your entitlement in certain circumstances, it's essential to seek further advice from an HR representative or a relevant authority to determine the specific implications for your situation.","['', ' Employment Rights Act 1996:\r\n', ' Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014']",5,False,"Amendment of the Shared Parental Leave and Paternity and Adoption Leave (Adoptions from Overseas) Regulations 2014

Wales,"A tenant in Wales is experiencing severe damp and mold in their rented property, which the landlord has failed to address despite repeated requests. Under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, what are the landlord's obligations regarding repairs and safety, and what actions can the tenant take to enforce these obligations?","Under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, landlords are obligated to maintain rental properties in a condition fit for human habitation. Specifically, Section 91 mandates that landlords must ensure the dwelling is fit for human habitation both at the start and throughout the duration of the tenancy. Section 92 requires landlords to keep in repair the structure and exterior of the dwelling, including drains, gutters, and external pipes, and to maintain installations for the supply of water, gas, electricity, sanitation, space heating, and heating water. If a landlord fails to address severe damp and mold despite repeated requests, the tenant should notify the landlord in writing, keeping records of all communications. If the landlord remains unresponsive, the tenant can contact the local authority's Environmental Health department, which can inspect the property and issue improvement notices. Additionally, the tenant may apply to the court for an order requiring the landlord to carry out repairs. It's advisable to seek legal advice before considering actions like withholding rent or arranging for repairs independently, as these carry legal risks.","Under the Renting Homes (Supplementary Provisions) (Wales) Regulations 2022, the landlord has several obligations regarding repairs and safety:

1. **Notify the tenant**: The tenant must notify the landlord as soon as reasonably practicable of any fault, defect, damage, or disrepair that they believe is the landlord's responsibility.
2. **Perform necessary repairs**: If the tenant believes that a fault, defect, damage, or disrepair is not the landlord's responsibility, they must carry out the necessary repairs within a reasonable period of time or replace items listed in the inventory.
3. **Prioritize safety**: The landlord is responsible for ensuring the dwelling is fit for human habitation, which includes addressing severe damp and mold issues.

If the tenant has repeatedly requested that the landlord address the issue, but nothing has been done, the tenant can take the following actions to enforce these obligations:

1. **Issue a formal request**: The tenant should send a formal letter or email to the landlord requesting that they address the issue within a specific timeframe (e.g., 14 days).
2. **Seek assistance from a housing authority**: If the landlord fails to respond, the tenant can contact their local housing authority for guidance and support.
3. **Take photographs and document evidence**: The tenant should take photographs and document evidence of the damage or disrepair to provide as proof if they need to escalate the issue further.
4. **Consider seeking a court order**: If the landlord fails to address the issue, the tenant can apply for a court order to enforce their rights under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016.

It's essential for tenants in Wales to familiarize themselves with their rights and responsibilities under the Renting Homes (Supplementary Provisions) (Wales) Regulations 2022 and to seek guidance from their local housing authority or a housing law expert if necessary.","['', "" Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, Section 91: Landlord's obligation: fitness for human habitation\r\n"", "" Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, Section 92: Landlord's obligation to keep dwelling in repair""]",5,False,"Repairs

Wales,"A retailer in Wales is found selling alcohol below the minimum unit price set by the Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018. They argue that discounts and promotions allow them to reduce prices. What does the Act stipulate regarding minimum alcohol pricing, and what penalties could the retailer face for non-compliance?","Under the Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018, it is an offence for alcohol retailers in Wales to sell alcohol below the applicable minimum price, regardless of discounts or promotions. The Act defines the minimum price using the formula M × S × V, where M is the minimum unit price (set at 50p), S is the percentage strength of the alcohol, and V is the volume in litres. Non-compliance can result in enforcement actions by local authorities, including the issuance of fixed penalty notices of £200 for each offence. Therefore, retailers must adhere to the minimum pricing regulations, as discounts and promotions do not permit selling alcohol below the established minimum price.","The Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018 stipulates that the price of alcohol in Wales should not be less than £0.05 per unit. The Act aims to reduce problem drinking and promote responsible consumption.

If a retailer in Wales fails to comply with this regulation, they could face penalties, including:

*   Fines: The retailer may be fined up to £2,000 for each day they fail to comply with the minimum price requirement.
*   Prosecution: In severe cases, the retailer may be prosecuted and face imprisonment for up to 3 months or an unlimited fine.
*   Loss of license: If the retailer is found to have repeatedly breached the regulations, their license to sell alcohol may be revoked.

Retailers in Wales must ensure that all alcoholic drinks sold in their premises are priced at or above £0.05 per unit to avoid these penalties.","['', ' Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018']",5,False,"This Statutory Instrument corrects an error made by S.I. 2021/1342 (W. 346) and is being issued free of charge to all known recipients of that Statutory Instrument.

Wales,"A homeowner in Wales wants to build a large extension to their property without applying for planning permission, arguing that it's within permitted development rights. Under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Wales) Order 1995 and recent amendments, what are the rules regarding extensions, and when is planning permission required?","Under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Wales) Order 1995, as amended, specific conditions allow certain extensions to be built without a formal planning application, known as permitted development rights. Below are the key provisions relevant to the homeowner’s question:\nRelevant Provisions for Extensions:\nVolume Limitations:\n                        * Terraced Houses or Properties on Article 1(5) Land: The cumulative volume of the extension must not exceed the volume of the original dwellinghouse by more than 50 cubic meters or 10% (whichever is greater).\n                        * Other Houses: The cumulative volume must not exceed 70 cubic meters or 15% (whichever is greater).\n                        * Absolute Limit: In all cases, the increase must not exceed 115 cubic meters.\nHeight Restrictions:\n                        * The height of the extension must not exceed the highest part of the existing roof.\n                        * For properties with a flat roof, the extension must not be taller than the height of the original dwellinghouse.\nProximity to Boundaries:\n                        * No part of the extension should be nearer to any highway than the nearest part of the original dwellinghouse unless the extension is at least 20 meters from the highway.\nDesignated Areas:\n                        * Properties in designated areas such as conservation areas, National Parks, or Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty have more restricted permitted development rights, potentially requiring formal planning permission even for smaller extensions.\nImportant Considerations:\n                        * Amendments: The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (Wales) Orders 2014 and 2019 introduce specific changes and clarifications but do not fundamentally alter the provisions related to standard extensions under Schedule 2, Part 1. The 2014 amendment refines some criteria for residential projects, while the 2019 amendment includes updates relevant to designated areas and certain types of land use.\n                        * Verification with Authorities: Due to potential nuances or recent legislative changes that could affect individual cases, consulting the local planning authority or a professional planner is crucial to confirm compliance with current regulations.","Under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Wales) Order 1995 and recent amendments, a homeowner in Wales can build certain types of extensions without applying for planning permission. These include:

* Single-storey extensions to dwellings or detached houses where the extension does not exceed 4 meters in rear elevation and 2 meters on each side
* Extensions to garages where they do not extend beyond the perimeter of the garage building or create a new roof slope
* Other minor alterations to existing buildings

However, certain types of extensions, such as those exceeding these limits or affecting listed buildings, will require planning permission.

Recent amendments, including the 2020 amendment, introduced emergency development powers for local authorities in Wales, which allow them to carry out certain development in an emergency without planning permission. This is subject to specific conditions and requirements.

In general, if a homeowner wants to build a large extension (i.e., not within permitted development rights) or one that exceeds the limits specified above, they will need to apply for planning permission from the local authority. The rules regarding extensions can be complex, and it's recommended that homeowners consult with a planning expert or check with their local authority to determine the specific requirements for their project.

In this case, if the homeowner wants to build a large extension without applying for planning permission, they may not be following the correct procedure and could face potential issues with their development.","['', ' The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, Schedule 2, Part 1\r\n', ' The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (Wales) Order 2014\r\n', ' The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (Wales) Order 2019']",5,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Here's how the Act safeguards these rights and the steps parents should take:\nHow the Act Protects the Child’s Right to Education\n                           * Definition of Additional Learning Needs (ALN) (Section 2): The Act defines ALN as a learning difficulty or disability that requires additional learning provision. This ensures children who face significantly greater learning challenges than their peers or have disabilities affecting their use of educational facilities are identified and supported.\n                           * Individual Development Plans (IDPs) (Section 10): The Act mandates the creation of IDPs for children with ALN. These comprehensive, tailored plans detail the specific support required and are maintained by local authorities or educational institutions, guaranteeing that each child's unique needs are met.\n                           * Duties of Local Authorities and Schools (Sections 11 and 14): Local authorities and the governing bodies of maintained schools have a duty to identify children with ALN and make appropriate provisions. They must review these provisions regularly to ensure their effectiveness and adapt them as needed.\n                           * Participation and Rights (Section 6): The Act emphasizes involving children and their parents in the decision-making process regarding ALN support. Authorities must also consider the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, reinforcing a rights-based approach.\n                           * Access to Information and Advice (Section 9): The Act requires local authorities to provide parents with information and advice on ALN and the available support, empowering them to make informed decisions.\n                           * Dispute Resolution and Appeals (Sections 68 and 70): The Act establishes clear mechanisms for resolving disagreements. If parents are unsatisfied with the IDP or support provided, they can use local dispute resolution services. Additionally, they have the right to appeal decisions to the Education Tribunal for Wales.\nSteps Parents Should Take to Ensure Their Child Receives Support\n                           * Request an Assessment: Parents can request that the local authority assess their child for ALN. Although the Act does not explicitly state this in Section 11, it mandates that authorities and schools must decide if a child has ALN when concerns are raised.\n                           * Engage in the IDP Process: Actively participate in the development and review of the IDP. Ensure the IDP reflects the child's current needs and advocate for revisions as needed.\n                           * Utilize Available Resources: Make use of the information and advice provided by local authorities as mandated in Section 9. This will help parents understand their rights and the provisions their child is entitled to.\n                           * Address Disagreements: If there are concerns about the IDP or the support provided, use the dispute resolution mechanisms outlined in Section 68. For unresolved issues, parents can appeal to the Education Tribunal for Wales as outlined in Section 70.\n                           * Regularly Review the IDP: Ensure that the IDP is reviewed regularly, as mandated by the Act, to keep it aligned with the child’s evolving educational needs.\nThis framework ensures that children with SEN in Wales receive the educational support they require, and parents are empowered to advocate effectively for their child’s rights.","The Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 plays a crucial role in protecting the rights of children with special educational needs (SEN) in Wales. The Act establishes a statutory framework for supporting children and young people with additional learning needs, replacing the legislation surrounding special educational needs and the assessment of children and young people with learning difficulties.

To protect the child's right to education, the Act ensures that provision is made for children who are of compulsory school age and below, have identified special educational needs (but not a statement), and are educated at an independent school or are home-educated. The provisions listed in article 3 come into force on 1 September 2022 in these circumstances.

However, the child's right to education is also protected through other provisions of the Act. For example, article 2 lists certain persons who will benefit from the commencement of the Order, including children and young people who are not over compulsory school age but are involved in the statutory framework of the Children and Families Act 2014.

To ensure that their child receives the necessary support, a parent in Wales should take the following steps:

1. Consult with the child's education authority: The parent should work with the child's education authority to identify the child's additional learning needs and develop an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan.
2. Request an EHC plan: The parent should request that an EHC plan be prepared for their child, which will outline the support required to meet the child's needs.
3. Attend the EHC panel meeting: The parent and other relevant professionals will attend a meeting with the EHC panel to discuss the child's EHC plan and make decisions about the support required.
4. Access mediation: If necessary, the parent can access mediation to resolve any disagreements with the education authority about the child's EHC plan.

The Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 also provides a mechanism for parents to appeal against decisions made by the education authority or EHC panel. The Tribunal hears appeals from parents who are dissatisfied with decisions made under the Act, providing an independent review of the decision-making process.

In summary, the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 protects the child's right to education through its provision of a statutory framework for supporting children and young people with additional learning needs. Parents in Wales can ensure their child receives the necessary support by working with the education authority to develop an EHC plan, attending EHC panel meetings, accessing mediation if necessary, and appealing against decisions made under the Act if necessary.","['', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 2: Definition of Additional Learning Needs (ALN)\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 6: Participation and Rights\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 9: Access to Information and Advice\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 10: Individual Development Plans (IDPs)\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 11: Duties to Decide: Maintained Schools and Further Education Institutions\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 14: Duties of Local Authorities and Schools\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 68: Dispute Resolution Mechanisms\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 70: Appeals to the Education Tribunal for Wales']",5,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Scotland,"An employee in Scotland has recently lost a child and is unsure of their entitlement to bereavement leave. Under the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018, what are their rights, and what obligations does the employer have?","Under the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018, incorporated into the Employment Rights Act 1996 and the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, employees in Scotland who have lost a child are entitled to specific rights, and employers have corresponding obligations. Section 80EA of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (as amended) grants eligible employees the right to take at least two weeks of parental bereavement leave. This leave must be taken within 56 days from the date of the child’s death and applies to the death of a child under 18. Section 80EE extends these rights to cases involving stillbirths after 24 weeks of pregnancy. Employers are obligated to provide this leave, ensuring that eligible employees can take time off without facing any detriment or dismissal related to their leave request. For statutory parental bereavement pay, Section 171ZZ6 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (as amended) outlines the entitlement, specifying that the employee must meet certain conditions such as a continuous employment period of at least 26 weeks ending with the ""relevant week"" (the week immediately before the child’s death) and minimum earnings meeting the lower earnings limit. Section 171ZZ7 adds that employees must give notice to their employer about the weeks for which they seek parental bereavement pay, and employers may require this notice in writing. Regulations under this section may also stipulate further requirements, such as providing evidence of entitlement or conditions for determining continuous employment. In addition to these primary sections, reviewing supporting regulations linked to the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018 and related guidance is essential for comprehensive compliance. Regulations detail how leave is to be taken, how statutory pay is processed, and additional procedural requirements for both employees and employers.","Under the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018, an employee in Scotland has the right to take bereavement leave following the death of a child. The exact terms and conditions of this leave vary depending on the specific regulations in place at the time of the employee's bereavement.

According to the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay (Consequential Amendments to Subordinate Legislation) Regulations 2020, employees are entitled to take up to 10 days of paid bereavement leave in a benefit period following the death of a child. This leave can be taken after the employee has been employed for at least one year.

Employers have certain obligations under the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018, including:

1. Providing employees with written information about their entitlement to bereavement leave.
2. Ensuring that employees receive statutory bereavement pay during their leave.
3. Allowing employees to take their bereavement leave without penalty or loss of pay.

It's worth noting that these regulations may have been superseded by a later version, and the most up-to-date information should be obtained from the relevant government website or department.

As for the employee's rights, they are entitled to:

1. Take up to 10 days of paid bereavement leave following the death of a child.
2. Receive statutory bereavement pay during their leave.
3. Have their bereavement leave taken without penalty or loss of pay.
4. Be provided with written information about their entitlement to bereavement leave.

It's recommended that the employee consults with their HR department or a relevant employment law expert to confirm their specific rights and obligations under the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018.","['', ' 1.

Additionally, installations for the supply of water, gas, electricity, sanitation, heating, and hot water must be kept in proper working order. Significant dampness and mold indicate a failure to meet this standard. Under Section 14, landlords have a duty to ensure that the house meets the repairing standard at the start of the tenancy and throughout its duration. This duty requires landlords to complete any necessary repairs within a reasonable time after being notified by the tenant or otherwise becoming aware of the need for repairs. Failure to act within a reasonable timeframe constitutes a breach of this duty. If the landlord does not take action, the tenant can apply to the First-tier Tribunal under Section 22 of the Act. This section allows tenants to seek a decision from the Tribunal if the property does not meet the Repairing Standard. The Tribunal can investigate and issue a Repairing Standard Enforcement Order (RSEO) under Section 24, compelling the landlord to carry out the required repairs within a specified timeframe. If the landlord fails to comply with the RSEO, under Section 26, the Tribunal must notify the local authority and may consider imposing a rent relief order to reduce the tenant’s rent. The Tribunal may excuse non-compliance if the landlord demonstrates an inability to comply due to a lack of necessary rights (e.g., access) or if the required work poses a danger to any person. In such cases, the Tribunal must notify the local authority of its findings. The Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 provides tenants with clear mechanisms to address substandard housing conditions and enforce their rights against landlords who fail to fulfill their obligations. These regulations govern the procedures of the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland Housing and Property Chamber, which is responsible for handling cases brought under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, including applications related to the Repairing Standard. The regulations ensure that disputes between tenants and landlords are resolved fairly and efficiently. They outline the rules for submitting applications, conducting hearings, issuing decisions, and enforcing orders such as Repairing Standard Enforcement Orders (RSEOs). This procedural framework directly supports tenants in seeking remedies for landlords' failures to meet their legal obligations under the Act.","Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, a landlord in Scotland is required to maintain a ""repairing standard"" of cleanliness and condition for their rental property. This means that landlords must ensure that their property is free from certain hazards, including dampness and mold.

In this scenario, if a tenant reports significant dampness and mold in their rented flat and the landlord has not taken any action, the landlord's obligations under the Act are as follows:

1. The landlord must take immediate steps to investigate and address the issue of dampness and mold.
2. The landlord must ensure that the property is safe for habitation by removing or mitigating the source of the dampness and mold.
3. If the landlord fails to comply with these obligations, they may be liable for damages under section 13(f) and (g) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, which relate to fire and carbon monoxide detection and warning equipment.

However, as mentioned in the explanatory note accompanying the relevant Regulations, sections 13(f) and (g) are being repealed by the amendment introduced by the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 (Tolerable Standard) (Extension of Criteria) Order 2019.

Given this repeal, it is likely that the landlord's obligations under section 13(f) and (g) do not apply to the issue at hand. Instead, the landlord's primary obligation is to address the dampness and mold in a way that ensures the property is safe for habitation.

To enforce these obligations, the tenant can take the following steps:

1. Report the issue to the landlord again, emphasizing the urgency of the situation.
2. Request a written response from the landlord within a reasonable timeframe, outlining their plan for addressing the dampness and mold.
3. If the landlord fails to respond or address the issue, consider contacting the Scottish Housing Ombudsman or seeking advice from a tenants' association.
4. If necessary, seek a court order requiring the landlord to take specific actions to address the dampness and mold.

It is worth noting that the Tenant's Rights (Scotland) Act 2019 provides further protections for tenants in Scotland, including provisions related to safety standards and reporting requirements. The tenant should be aware of these rights and consider seeking advice on how to enforce them.

In summary, while the landlord may not be directly liable under sections 13(f) and (g), they still have a duty to address the dampness and mold in a way that ensures the property is safe for habitation. The tenant can take steps to enforce this obligation by reporting the issue again, requesting a written response from the landlord, and seeking further assistance if necessary.","['', ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 13: The Repairing Standard\r\n', "" Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 14: Landlord's Duty to Repair and Maintain\r\n"", ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 22: Application to the First', 'tier Tribunal\r\n', ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 24: Repairing Standard Enforcement Order (RSEO)\r\n', ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 26: Effect of Failure to Comply with Repairing Standard Enforcement Order\r\n', ' Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014\r\n', ' First', 'tier Tribunal for Scotland Housing and Property Chamber (Procedure) Regulations 2017 https://www.legislation.gov.Unitedkingdom/ssi/2017/328/contents/made']",5,False,"Safeguards for landlords: substantial rent arrears and financial hardship

Scotland,"An individual in Scotland is experiencing domestic abuse from their partner with whom they share a tenancy. They wish to remove the abuser from the home but are unsure of their rights. Under the Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021, what legal protections are available, and what steps should they take?","Individuals experiencing domestic abuse in Scotland can seek protection through several legal mechanisms. Under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, they can apply for a Non-Harassment Order, which prohibits the abuser from engaging in threatening or harassing behavior. Additionally, the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981 allows for an Exclusion Order to remove the abuser from the shared home and prevent them from re-entering. This Act applies not only to married couples but also to cohabitants. The individual should contact the police to report the abuse, as domestic abuse is a criminal offense under the Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2018, which recognizes controlling behavior as abuse. Seeking legal advice from a solicitor experienced in domestic abuse cases is advisable to assist with applications for protective orders, and engaging with support services such as Scottish Women's Aid can provide additional assistance and guidance.","Under the Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021, the individual experiencing domestic abuse has several legal protections available:

1. **Ground for recovery of possession**: Section 14(1A) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 is amended by section 4 of the Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021 to include a new ground for recovery of possession, which allows the landlord to recover possession if the tenant has engaged in behaviour that is abusive towards their partner or ex-partner.

2. **Notice requirements**: Section 14(3A) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 is amended by section 5 of the Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021 to require a landlord to serve a notice on the tenant under certain circumstances, including when recovering possession due to abusive behaviour.

3. **Notice period**: Section 14(4A) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 is amended by section 5 of the Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021 to provide a specific notice period for landlords serving a notice on tenants under certain circumstances, including when recovering possession due to abusive behaviour.

4. **Rent arrears**: Section 14(3A) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 is amended by section 5 of the Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021 to provide that rent arrears can be waived if the tenant has served a notice on the landlord under certain circumstances, including when recovering possession due to abusive behaviour.

To take advantage of these protections, the individual experiencing domestic abuse should:

1. **Seek advice**: Consult with a solicitor or other legal professional who is familiar with domestic abuse law in Scotland.
2. **Gather evidence**: Collect any relevant evidence of the abusive behaviour, such as police reports, witness statements, or records of incidents.
3. **Serve notice on landlord**: Follow the correct procedure for serving a notice on the landlord under section 14(3A) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006.
4. **Apply to court**: If the landlord fails to comply with the notice, the individual can apply to the court for an order to recover possession or terminate the joint tenant's interest.

It is essential to note that these protections are subject to certain conditions and requirements, and the individual should seek advice from a qualified professional to ensure they follow the correct procedures.","['', ' Protection from Harassment Act 1997\r\n', ' Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981\r\n', ' Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2018']",5,False,"Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021

Scotland,"A retailer in Scotland is considering selling alcohol below the minimum unit price due to competitive pressures. They want to know the legal implications. Under the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012, what are the retailer's obligations, and what penalties could they face for non-compliance? ","Under the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012, which amends the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, retailers in Scotland are required to sell alcohol at or above a minimum unit price (MPU) set by the Scottish Ministers. This rule applies to all licensed premises, including shops, bars, restaurants, and temporary events with occasional licenses. The minimum price condition is detailed in Schedule 3, Paragraph 6A for premises licenses and Schedule 4, Paragraph 5A for occasional licenses. Alcohol must be sold at a minimum price calculated by multiplying the MPU by the strength and volume of the alcohol. As amended by The Alcohol (Minimum Price per Unit) (Scotland) Order 2018, the current MPU is set at 65 pence per unit. Retailers must comply with this minimum price, and selling alcohol below this threshold constitutes a breach of licensing conditions. If a retailer fails to meet the minimum pricing requirement, Section 36 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 allows the licensing board to review the premises license and impose penalties as needed. Following a review, the board may suspend the license temporarily, revoke the license entirely, or modify the license conditions to enforce compliance. These penalties aim to uphold public health and ensure responsible alcohol sales.","Under the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012, a retailer in Scotland is obligated to sell alcohol at or above the minimum unit price set by law. The retailer must ensure that all alcohol sold on their premises complies with this requirement.

If a retailer fails to comply with this obligation, they may face penalties, including:

1. Fines: The Scottish Government can impose fines on retailers who fail to comply with the minimum pricing regulations. The fine amount is not specified in the Act but can be determined by the court.
2. Prosecution: Retailers who deliberately or recklessly sell alcohol below the minimum price can be prosecuted under the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2003. If convicted, they may face a fine and/or imprisonment for up to two years.
3. License suspension or revocation: The Licensing Board can suspend or revoke a retailer's license to sell alcohol if they fail to comply with the minimum pricing regulations.

It is essential for retailers to verify their compliance with the minimum unit price before selling alcohol to avoid any potential legal issues and penalties. They can do this by checking the Alcohol (Minimum Unit Price) Regulations 2019, which outline the specific requirements and guidelines for selling alcohol in Scotland.

In summary, a retailer in Scotland must sell alcohol at or above the minimum unit price set by law to avoid facing fines, prosecution, or license suspension/revocation. It is crucial to stay up-to-date with the latest regulations and ensure compliance to avoid any legal issues.","['', ' Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, Schedule 3, Paragraph 6A ', ' Premises Licence Mandatory Conditions\r\n', ' Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, Schedule 4, Paragraph 5A ', ' Occasional Licence Mandatory Conditions\r\n', ' The Alcohol (Minimum Price per Unit) (Scotland) Order 2018 ', ' Minimum Unit Pricing for Alcohol in Scotland\r\n', ' Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, Section 36 ', ' Application for Review of Premises Licence:']",5,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order is made under section 2(2) of the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012 (“the 2012 Act”). It comes into force on 30 April 2024.
Section 1 of the 2012 Act inserted provisions into schedules 3 and 4 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, introducing a further mandatory condition of premises licences and occasional licences. The condition is that alcohol must not be sold on the premises at a price below its minimum price. These provisions are the “minimum pricing provisions”.
Section 2(1) of the 2012 Act provides that the minimum pricing provisions expire 6 years after section 1 of the 2012 Act came fully into force unless an Order is made under section 2(2) of that Act to continue the effect of those provisions.

Scotland,"A parent in Scotland believes their child requires additional support in school due to a learning difficulty. Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 (as amended), what rights does the child have, and what steps can the parent take to secure the necessary support?","Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004, as amended, children in Scotland who require additional support due to learning difficulties are legally entitled to specific rights. Education authorities have a duty to assess and provide for these needs when required. According to Section 8(1), if a parent requests an assessment to determine whether their child has additional support needs or requires a Co-ordinated Support Plan (CSP), the education authority must comply with this request unless it is deemed unreasonable. Following assessment, Section 4(1)(a) requires the education authority to make adequate and efficient provision for the identified needs, which can include specialized resources or tailored teaching approaches. If a child’s support needs involve multiple agencies, such as social work or healthcare in addition to education, Section 9(1) ensures they are entitled to a CSP, a document outlining coordinated support across agencies. Parents also have the right, under Section 12(2), to be actively involved in developing and reviewing support plans to ensure that their child’s educational requirements are fully understood and addressed. If disagreements arise regarding the support provided or decisions made, Section 18(1) grants parents the right to appeal to the Additional Support Needs Tribunal for Scotland, which can make binding rulings on disputes related to additional support. These legislative provisions provide a strong framework for ensuring children’s educational needs are met and give parents a clear process to advocate for the support their child requires.","Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004, a child who requires additional support in school due to a learning difficulty has several key rights.

Firstly, the child has the right to an Education, Training and Care Plan (ETCP). This plan is a personalized document that outlines the child's needs, goals, and strategies for achieving those goals. The ETCP should be developed in collaboration with the child, their parents/carers, teachers, and other relevant professionals.

Secondly, the child has the right to access support services, including speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, or other interventions that can help address the learning difficulty. These services should be provided within a reasonable timeframe after the ETCP is established.

Thirdly, the child has the right to regular review of their ETCP to ensure it remains relevant and effective. This review should take place at least once every three years, but may need to occur more frequently if the child's needs change.

As a parent in Scotland, you can take several steps to secure the necessary support for your child:

1. Work with your child's teachers: Collaborate with your child's teachers and other school staff to identify their strengths and weaknesses and develop strategies for addressing the learning difficulty.
2. Request an ETCP: Ask your child's teacher or education authority to develop an ETCP that outlines your child's needs, goals, and support requirements.
3. Meet with education professionals: Schedule meetings with education professionals, such as teachers, counselors, or speech therapists, to discuss your child's needs and develop a plan for supporting them.
4. Seek mediation: If you have disagreements with the education authority about your child's ETCP or the provision of support services, consider seeking mediation through an independent advocate or a representative body, such as the Scottish Parent Teacher Council (SPTC).
5. Advocate for your child: Regularly meet with education professionals and the education authority to ensure that your child's needs are being met and that their ETCP is being implemented effectively.

It's essential to remember that as a parent in Scotland, you have rights and responsibilities under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004. You should work closely with education professionals and other stakeholders to ensure that your child receives the support they need to succeed in school.

Additionally, the Scottish Government has established several organizations and resources to support parents and children with additional needs, including:

* The Scottish Parent Teacher Council (SPTC): A representative body for parents who provides advice, guidance, and support on education issues.
* The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004: This act outlines the rights and responsibilities of parents and children in accessing additional support services.
* The Scottish Schools (Health and Well-being) (Primary 1-7) Act 2018: This act emphasizes the importance of health and well-being in education and provides a framework for supporting pupils' mental health and wellbeing.

By working together with education professionals, other parents, and these organizations, you can ensure that your child receives the support they need to succeed in school.",['Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004'],5,False,"Provision of advocacy services

NothernIreland,"An individual in NothernIreland is experiencing domestic abuse and seeks protection from their abuser. Under the Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (NothernIreland) 2021, what legal protections are available, and what steps should they take to secure those protections?","An individual in NothernIreland experiencing domestic abuse is protected under the Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (NothernIreland) 2021. Specifically, Section 1 of the Act criminalizes a course of abusive behaviour towards a person to whom the abuser is personally connected, such as a partner, ex-partner, or family member. The individual should report the abuse to the Police Service of NothernIreland to initiate a criminal investigation under this Act. Section 2 defines ""abusive behaviour"" as behaviour that is violent or threatening, or behaviour where a reasonable person would consider the course of behaviour likely to cause one or more of the following effects on the victim (B):
                                       * Making B dependent on, or subordinate to, A (the abuser);
                                       * Isolating B from friends, relatives, or other sources of social interaction or support;
                                       * Controlling, regulating, or monitoring B's day-to-day activities;
                                       * Depriving B of, or restricting, freedom of action;
                                       * Frightening, humiliating, degrading, or punishing B.
While the Act does not provide specific protective orders, the individual may apply for a Non-Molestation Order or an Occupation Order under the Family Homes and Domestic Violence (NothernIreland) Order 1998. A Non-Molestation Order can prohibit the abuser from molesting the applicant or a relevant child, and an Occupation Order can regulate the occupation of the shared residence. Additionally, Sections 25 to 28 of the Act offer special measures in civil proceedings to support victims, such as prohibiting the abuser from cross-examining the victim in person.
To secure these protections, the individual should:
                                       1. Report the abuse to the Police Service of NothernIreland to initiate criminal proceedings under the Act.
                                       2. Seek legal advice to apply for a Non-Molestation Order or an Occupation Order through the courts.
                                       3. Utilize the special measures provided in the Act during any civil proceedings to ensure their safety and well-being.","If someone in Northern Ireland is experiencing domestic abuse and seeking protection from their abuser, there are several legal protections available under the Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (Northern Ireland) 2021. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to secure these protections:

**Step 1: Apply for a Prohibition Order**

An individual can apply for a prohibition order through the County Court in Northern Ireland. This type of order restricts contact between the parties, including physical contact, telephone calls, emails, and visits.

To apply, the individual must provide evidence of domestic abuse, such as police records or witness statements, to support their application. They may also need to demonstrate that they have a genuine fear for their safety or well-being.

**Step 2: Seek a Non-Molestation Order**

A non-molestation order is another type of court order that restricts contact between the parties. This order can be sought by either party and is intended to protect individuals from unwanted behavior, such as harassment or intimidation.

To apply for a non-molestation order, the individual must demonstrate that they have suffered domestic abuse and that it has caused them fear or distress.

**Step 3: Apply for an Occupation Order**

An occupation order restricts one party's occupation of property where the other party resides. This can be particularly useful in cases where one partner has taken up residence in a shared home without their partner's consent.

To apply for an occupation order, the individual must demonstrate that they have been subjected to domestic abuse and that it is necessary to limit contact with their abuser.

**Step 4: Seek Protection under Article 28 of the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995**

If a child is involved in the situation, the individual can apply for protection under Article 28 of the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995. This article provides for waiving the financial eligibility rules to enable individuals to be represented in proceedings involving contact, residence, or other issues related to a child's care.

To access this protection, the individual must demonstrate that they are a victim of domestic abuse and that their application is being brought against their abuser.

**Step 5: Contact the Police**

In cases where there is an immediate risk of harm, it is essential to contact the police. They can provide emergency assistance and support until a court order can be obtained.

The individual should also consider contacting a local domestic violence service or support organization for guidance, advice, and emotional support throughout the process.

It's crucial to note that anyone experiencing domestic abuse in Northern Ireland can seek help and protection through various organizations, including:

* The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI)
* Ulster Volunteer Defence League (UVDL)
* Northern Ireland Domestic Violence Forum
* local women's charities and organizations

These resources can provide valuable support, guidance, and advocacy throughout the process.","['', ' Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (NothernIreland) 2021\r\n', ' Family Homes and Domestic Violence (NothernIreland) Order 1998']",5,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

NothernIreland,"An employee in NothernIreland suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage. Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015, what are their rights, and what steps can they take to address the issue?","Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015, an employee in NothernIreland who suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage (NMW) has specific rights and actionable steps to address the issue. The Act mandates that employees must be paid at least the NMW, as set out in Section 1(1), which establishes the legal entitlement to minimum wage for all qualifying workers. Employers are legally required to keep accurate records of wage payments under Section 9 of the Act. These records should be sufficient to demonstrate that an employee is being paid at least the NMW. Therefore, the first step for the employee is to review their pay records to confirm any potential underpayment. Should there be a discrepancy, Section 10 grants the employee the right to formally request access to these records, enabling them to verify their calculations against the NMW requirement. If the employee identifies an underpayment, they should raise this issue with their employer, as it may be an oversight. If the employer fails to resolve the issue, the employee can escalate the matter to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the body responsible for enforcing compliance. While Section 13 of the Act authorizes the Secretary of State to appoint officers for enforcement purposes, Section 14 provides HMRC officers with the power to issue enforcement notices if employers are found non-compliant.  While the Act provides the primary framework, the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015 offer additional details for specific situations, such as valuing accommodation benefits or adjusting for absences, which can influence wage calculations. For most straightforward underpayment cases, the Act alone provides the necessary rights and procedures, with the Regulations supporting only in specific circumstances affecting wage calculation. In addition to these provisions, the Employment Rights (NothernIreland) Order 1996 is also relevant as it grants the employee a procedural framework for seeking redress if they are not compensated as per the NMW. Under the 1996 Order, if an employee experiences a sustained issue with underpayment, they have the right to file a claim with an Industrial Tribunal. This Order, though not specifically addressing minimum wage rates, is essential for the employee’s right to fair wages, as it permits claims for unlawful deduction of wages or breach of contract, allowing the employee to recover underpaid amounts. The 1996 Order thus complements the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 by establishing legal recourse in cases of wage disputes.","Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2015, an employee in Northern Ireland who suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage has several rights and options to address the issue.

Firstly, according to section 31(1) of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, it is an offence for an employer to refuse or wilfully neglect to pay an employee their national minimum wage. This means that if an employee feels they are being underpaid, they can report the issue to HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs), the UK tax authority responsible for enforcing the National Minimum Wage laws.

The National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015 also provide clarity on the entitlement to pay and penalties for failure to comply. Specifically, section 16 of the regulations states that an employee who is paid less than the national minimum wage is entitled to receive their full entitlement from the date of the underpayment.

If an employee feels they are being underpaid, they can take several steps to address the issue:

1. **Report the issue to HMRC**: The employee should contact HMRC to report the suspected underpayment and request a payment on account. HMRC will then investigate the matter and may take enforcement action against the employer if necessary.
2. **Keep records of pay and correspondence**: The employee should keep detailed records of their pay, including payslips, bank statements, and any correspondence with the employer regarding the issue. This documentation can be useful in supporting a claim for back pay or other remedies.
3. **Seek advice from an ACAS (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service) service**: The employee can contact ACAS for free advice and guidance on how to deal with the situation. ACAS can also provide assistance with resolving disputes between employers and employees.
4. **Consider seeking representation from a trade union or employment law expert**: If the issue is complex or significant, the employee may want to seek representation from a trade union or an employment law expert who can provide guidance on the best course of action.

In summary, under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2015, an employee in Northern Ireland has several rights and options if they suspect they are being paid below the national minimum wage. Reporting the issue to HMRC, keeping records, seeking advice from ACAS or a trade union/employment law expert, and considering taking action through the employment tribunal system can all help address the situation.","['', ' National Minimum Wage Act 1998\r\n', ' National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015\r\n', ' The Employment Rights (NothernIreland) Order 1996']",5,False,"2.

NothernIreland,"An employee in NothernIreland has recently lost a child and is unsure about their entitlement to bereavement leave and pay. Under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022, what are their rights, and how can they access them?","Under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022, an employee in NothernIreland who has recently lost a child is entitled to bereavement leave, and if they meet certain criteria, they may also be eligible for bereavement pay. Article 112EA(1)-(3) defines a ""bereaved parent"" as an employee who meets specified relationship conditions with the deceased child, which may include a caregiving role before the child’s death. Employees who lose a child under 18, or experience a stillbirth after 24 weeks of pregnancy, are entitled to at least two weeks of bereavement leave under Article 112EA(5). This leave can be taken either as a single two-week block or in two separate one-week periods. According to Article 112EA(6), this leave must be taken within at least 56 days (eight weeks) from the date of the child’s death, providing flexibility within that period.
If an employee loses more than one child, Article 112EA(7) entitles them to bereavement leave for each child. Article 112EB outlines rights during and after bereavement leave, specifying that employees on leave retain most employment terms and conditions (excluding remuneration). According to Article 112EB(1)(a)-(c), employees are entitled to return to their original or an equivalent job after bereavement leave. Furthermore, Article 112EB(3) provides that if bereavement leave coincides with other types of parental leave (such as maternity or paternity leave), the right to return applies across the entire period of absence.
To access bereavement leave, Article 112ED(a) requires employees to notify their employer as soon as reasonably practicable, specifying the intended dates for leave. Employers are obligated to grant this leave and cannot delay or refuse it. If the employee is also eligible for statutory bereavement pay, they must provide notice and any required documentation as directed under Articles 112ED(a) and (c).","Under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022, an employee in NothernIreland who has recently lost a child is entitled to bereavement leave and pay. Their rights include:

* Substantive requirements: They must fall within the definition of a bereaved parent, including specified types of parental relationships.
* Procedural requirements: They must give appropriate notices to their employer before taking parental bereavement leave.
* The employee has the option to take either one or two weeks' parental bereavement leave.
* The weeks taken as parental bereavement leave do not need to be taken consecutively.
* Parental bereavement leave may only be taken within the period of 56 weeks beginning with the date of the child's death.

To access their rights, the employee should:

* Provide notice to their employer before taking parental bereavement leave, as specified in regulation 6.
* Be subject to all obligations under their terms and conditions of employment, apart from the right to remuneration, during their absence on leave (regulation 9).
* Have protection from detriment and dismissal attributable to the fact that they took or sought to take parental bereavement leave (regulations 12 and 13).

The employee can also access additional information about their rights by reviewing the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2022, which provide further details on the substantive and procedural requirements for bereavement leave.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers inserted into the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 (N.I. 16) (the “1996 Order”) by the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 (c. 5).
The Regulations revoke and re-enact the provisions of the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023 which would otherwise cease to have effect by virtue of Article 251(1A) of the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996.
These Regulations provide for a statutory entitlement for bereaved parents who are employees to take up to two weeks’ leave from their job called parental bereavement leave in the 56 weeks following the death of a child.
Part 2 relates to entitlement to parental bereavement leave. The right to take parental bereavement leave is conferred by regulation 4 which sets out the conditions for entitlement which must be satisfied by the employee in order to take parental bereavement leave. These include substantive requirements, such as the employee falling within the definition of a bereaved parent (in particular, specifying the types of parental relationships in respect of which the new entitlement arises), as well as procedural requirements, such as the employee giving appropriate notices to their employer. Where an employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave under regulation 4 as the result of the death of more than one child, the employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave in respect of each child.
Regulation 5 sets out the number of weeks of parental bereavement leave that are available to a bereaved parent and gives an employee the option of taking either one or two weeks’ parental bereavement leave. The weeks taken as parental bereavement leave do not need to be taken consecutively. It also provides that parental bereavement leave may only be taken within the period of 56 weeks beginning with the date of the child’s death.
Regulation 6 details the notice requirements and other information the bereaved parent must provide to their employer before taking parental bereavement leave. An employee does not need to provide notice in writing to his or her employer, but the length of notice required to book and cancel parental bereavement leave will vary depending on whether the period the employee intends to take as parental bereavement leave falls within 56 days of the child’s death or later. Regulations 7 and 8 respectively set out when an employee’s period of bereavement leave may start and what happens when a period of parental bereavement leave is interrupted by another type of statutory leave under Part 9 of the 1996 Order.
Part 3 contains provisions applicable in relation to the taking of parental bereavement leave. Regulation 9 elaborates on the new Article 112EB of the 1996 Order, by providing that an employee is entitled during his or her absence on leave to the benefit of all of his or her terms and conditions of employment apart from the right to remuneration (excluded by Article 112EB(2)(b)); also that the employee is subject to all of the obligations under those terms and conditions except in so far as they are inconsistent with the right to take parental bereavement leave (the exception appears in Article 112EB(1)(b)). Regulations 10 and 11 provide for an employee’s right to return to work after taking a period of parental bereavement leave, distinguishing the case where the leave was an isolated period of absence from the case where it followed another period of statutory leave. Regulations 12 and 13 provide that an employee entitled to parental bereavement leave is protected from detriment and dismissal attributable to the fact that they took or sought to take parental bereavement leave.
Part 4 contains provisions applicable where an employee has a contractual right to parental bereavement leave, in addition to the statutory right contained within these Regulations.
Part 5 (regulations 16 to 22) contains provisions in respect of the Transitional arrangements that will ensure a continuity of entitlement between the revoked Regulations and current Regulations. This part also contains the revocation of the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023.
A separate impact assessment has not been prepared for these Regulations. The Regulations are part of a package of legislative measures and the relevant impact assessment is the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill impact assessment which was published in April 2020.

NothernIreland,"A tenant in NothernIreland has been served an eviction notice by their landlord, giving them four weeks to vacate the property. The tenant has lived there for two years under a periodic tenancy. Under the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, is the notice period valid, and what rights does the tenant have?","Under the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, a landlord’s notice to quit a property must meet specific statutory notice periods based on the length of the tenancy. This Act amends the Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006, particularly Article 14, to reflect updated notice requirements. For a tenant who has lived in the property for two years under a periodic tenancy, Section 11 of the 2022 Act amends Article 14 of the 2006 Order to specify that the landlord must provide at least 4 months’ notice before requiring the tenant to vacate. This 4-month period applies to tenancies that have existed for more than 12 months but not more than 3 years (as outlined in the new Article 14(1A)(b)). Because the landlord provided only four weeks’ notice, this does not satisfy the legal requirement, rendering the notice invalid. The tenant has the right to remain in the property until a valid notice to quit is served that meets the legally required notice period. Under Section 11 of the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, which amends Article 14 of the Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006, landlords are required to give a minimum 4-month notice for tenancies that have lasted more than 12 months but not more than 3 years. Because the tenant has lived in the property for two years, the landlord’s four-week notice does not meet this requirement and is therefore invalid. The tenant may choose to inform the landlord in writing that the notice is invalid due to the insufficient notice period, referencing Article 14(1), which states that a notice to quit is only valid if it complies with the minimum notice periods required by law. If the landlord proceeds with eviction attempts despite the invalid notice, the tenant may seek legal remedies. While specific injunctions or protections against harassment are not outlined within this tenancy legislation, the tenant may still seek legal assistance through broader NothernIreland housing or civil law protections to prevent an unlawful eviction and maintain peaceful possession of the property.","Under the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, the notice period given by the landlord to the tenant is not valid. The act states that for a periodic tenancy with a two-month minimum notice period, the notice must be given at least two months after the day on which the notice was given to the contract-holder as a result of section 174A(1) of the Act or paragraph 25A(2)(2) of Schedule 12 to section 174(1) of the Act.

In this case, since the tenant has lived in the property for two years under a periodic tenancy, the landlord should have given them at least two months' notice. However, if the landlord gave the eviction notice immediately after serving the tenant with a ""notice of withdrawal"" from the rent variation notice, then the notice period would be invalid.

The tenant's rights include:

1.  The right to continue living in the property for an additional two-month period.
2.  The right to request a longer notice period if possible
3.  The landlord is not entitled to evict the tenant without following the proper procedures and giving the required notice period.

It's recommended that the tenant seeks legal advice from a qualified professional to understand their rights and options in this situation.","['', ' Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022 ', ' Section 11\r\n', ' Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006 ', ' Article 14']",5,False,"Notice to quit: private tenancies

Additionally, the Act allows for Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs), detailed in Section 7, which the Chief Constable can apply for. These orders are designed to prevent further stalking activities by imposing specific prohibitions or requirements on the stalker. The eligibility for an SPO is based on evidence that the individual has engaged in stalking, poses a risk related to stalking, and that the order is necessary to protect someone from this risk. These orders can be applied against anyone residing in, or intending to visit, NothernIreland. The duration of these orders is addressed in Section 9, where an SPO can last for a minimum of two years or until further court order. The court may specify that some conditions within the SPO remain effective until further judicial review while setting others for fixed periods. This flexibility allows the protective measures to be adapted over time to match the needs of the situation. For their safety, affected individuals should report stalking incidents to the Police Service of NothernIreland (PSNI), enabling legal proceedings that could include the issuance of an SPO. Consulting legal advice and engaging with support services are also advisable steps to ensure comprehensive protection and support.","Under the Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, the individual who is being harassed and stalked by an ex-partner has several legal protections available to them. Firstly, they can apply for a Stalking Protection Order (SPO), which is a court order that requires the perpetrator to stop stalking behavior and stay away from the victim.

To apply for an SPO, the individual must provide evidence of the stalking behavior, including incidents where they felt threatened or intimidated, and demonstrate that they are at risk of further harm. The court will then consider this application and may issue an SPO if it is satisfied that the perpetrator poses a significant risk to the victim.

Another option for the individual is to apply for an interim Stalking Protection Order (iSPO), which is a temporary order that can be issued while the full application is being processed. This type of order can provide immediate protection for the victim and give them time to gather evidence and build their case.

In addition to applying for a SPO or iSPO, the individual should also consider taking steps to ensure their safety. This may include:

* Documenting incidents: Keeping a record of all incidents where they feel threatened or stalked, including dates, times, locations, and any witnesses.
* Reporting incidents: Reporting incidents to the police and providing them with as much detail as possible.
* Seeking support: Talking to friends, family, or a counselor about their experiences and getting emotional support.
* Changing behavior: Avoiding places or situations that may trigger stalking behavior or taking steps to make it harder for the perpetrator to find them.

It's also worth noting that the individual should be aware of their rights under the Act, including:

* The right to protection from stalking behavior
* The right to an order requiring the perpetrator to stop stalking behavior and stay away
* The right to compensation if they are awarded damages in a court case

To seek help and support, the individual can contact organizations such as:

* The Northern Ireland Domestic Abuse Service
* Victim Support
* Women's Aid
* Rape Crisis Northern Ireland

These organizations provide confidential support, counseling, and advice on how to deal with stalking behavior. They may also be able to provide information on local support services and help the individual develop a safety plan.

In summary, under the Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, the individual has several legal protections available to them, including applying for a SPO or iSPO, documenting incidents, reporting incidents, seeking support, and changing behavior. They should also be aware of their rights and seek help and support from organizations that specialize in dealing with domestic abuse and stalking.","['', ' Protection from Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022']",5,False,"Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022
