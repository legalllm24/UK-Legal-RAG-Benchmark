Fantastic work!",0.8461538461538461,"The score is 0.85 because the model hallucinates key details such as the act number, year, and leave duration, contradicting information from the provided contexts. While there is some alignment in the general concept of parental bereavement leave and choosing between statutory and contractual rights, the numerous factual inaccuracies significantly impact the overall accuracy."
1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the response directly addresses the question about the validity of the eviction notice under the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 and the tenant's rights, providing a completely relevant and accurate answer.",1.0,The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions.,0.48333333333333334,"The score is 0.48 because while the first relevant node in retrieval context correctly points to 'Article 14 of the Private Tenancies (Northern Ireland) Order 2006, which is key to the question and is amended by Section 11 of the 2022 Act to specify the notice period', several irrelevant nodes, such as the second node discussing 'emergency period modifications', are ranked higher.  The subsequent irrelevant nodes in the retrieval context, such as the third node's 'explanatory note about regulations extending the emergency period', the fourth node's 'explanatory note discussing extending the emergency period', the fifth node's 'explanatory note also discusses extending the emergency period', the sixth node's 'explanatory note unrelated to Northern Ireland's Private Tenancies Act 2022', the seventh and eighth nodes discussing regulations in England, and the eleventh node's discussion of 'rent variation notices', are also ranked higher than other relevant nodes. Although relevant nodes discussing 'Schedule 2' and 'bringing into operation certain provisions of the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022' are present, their lower ranking contributes to the lower contextual precision score.  The high ranking of irrelevant nodes, particularly those related to emergency periods and other jurisdictions, reduces the overall precision.",0.8888888888888888,"The score is 0.89 because the majority of the expected output (sentences 1-8) aligns perfectly with the information provided in node(s) in retrieval context, specifically detailing the legal requirements of notice periods under the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022 and its amendments to the 2006 Order. However, sentence 9, concerning broader NothernIreland housing or civil law protections, is not covered in the provided node(s), resulting in a slightly lower score.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the model hallucinated a six-month minimum notice period for evictions in Northern Ireland, a fact not supported by the provided contexts.  The contexts discuss various notice periods and regulations, but none mention a six-month minimum.  Several contexts even describe different, shorter notice periods or address unrelated eviction regulations in other regions."
0.09090909090909091,"The score is 0.09 because the response contains numerous irrelevant metadata fields (model version, timestamps, durations, counts, etc.) unrelated to the legal question about protections under the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022.  These irrelevant statements significantly detract from the relevance of the response to the core legal query.",0.9473684210526315,"The score is 0.95 because the actual output incorrectly states that the Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 came into force on April 27, 2022, when it actually came into force on April 26, 2022.",0.7836174242424243,"The score is 0.78 because the ranking shows that while most of the top-ranked nodes in the retrieval context are highly relevant, providing crucial information about the ""Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022"", such as its definition of stalking, potential penalties, and the availability of Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs) (first node), and details about applying for and managing Stalking Protection Orders (fourth node), some irrelevant nodes, such as those referencing the ""Protection from Harassment Act 1997"" (third and seventh nodes) and the ""Stalking Protection Act 2019 (c. 9)"" (sixth node),  are ranked too high.  The presence of these irrelevant nodes, particularly the repeated mentions of the 1997 act, lowers the score.  If these irrelevant nodes were ranked lower, the contextual precision would improve.  For example, the information in the third node, which states that it ""refers to the Protection from Harassment Act 1997"", is completely unrelated, and similarly for the sixth and twelfth nodes; these should be below highly relevant nodes that provide specific legal protections under the 2022 Act. The eleventh and thirteenth nodes are also misplaced, considering the former is only a commencement order and the latter is a simple citation.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are perfectly supported by information found in the nodes in retrieval context.  Each sentence, from the Act's definition of stalking (sentence 2, supported by node 1 and others) to the advice for seeking help (sentence 10, supported by node 1 and the overall context), aligns with the information provided.  Fantastic work!",0.07692307692307693,"The score is 0.08 because the model shows strong alignment with the provided context regarding the Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, correctly referencing multiple sections and related legislation.
