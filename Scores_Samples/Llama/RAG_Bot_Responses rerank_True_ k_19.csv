This low precision is due to a significant number of irrelevant nodes (the first six nodes) outranking relevant ones. For example, the first node discusses ""extensions to the emergency period under the Private Tenancies (Coronavirus Modifications) Act (Northern Ireland) 2020"", while the seventh node only demonstrates that ""the length of notice to quit is subject to legislative change"" which is less directly relevant than a direct answer related to the 2022 act.",0.0,"The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output are supported by the provided retrieval context.  All sentences, from the explanation of the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022 and its amendments to the advice on legal remedies, lack any corroborating information in node(s) in retrieval context.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the model hallucinated a six-month notice period, which is not supported by any of the provided contexts.  The contexts discuss various aspects of tenant protections, notice requirements for rent variations, and emergency period extensions, but none mention a six-month general notice period for termination."
1.0,The score is 1.00 because the response directly addresses the user's question about legal protections and steps to take under the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 for a victim of stalking.  There are no irrelevant statements.,1.0,The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions.,0.8083333333333332,"The score is 0.81 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context, providing details on the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, such as definitions of stalking, Stalking Protection Orders, and acts associated with stalking, are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes.  For example, the first two nodes correctly address the legal protections, while later nodes (third and fifth) incorrectly address the 1997 Protection from Harassment Act instead of the 2022 Stalking Act. The seventh node is also irrelevant as it is an explanatory note on amendments to the Criminal Legal Aid (General) Regulations 2013.  The ninth node repeats the mistake of mentioning the 1997 Act.  This demonstrates a good separation of relevant and irrelevant information based on the ranking.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the provided text perfectly summarizes the key aspects of the Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, covering the definition of stalking (sentence 2), penalties (sentence 3), Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs) (sentences 4-6), and advice for victims (sentences 7-8).  All sentences in the expected output are directly supported by information from node(s) in retrieval context.  Fantastic work!",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the actual output completely ignores the provided legal text focusing instead on general advice about obtaining a protection order, omitting specific details, sections, and the overall purpose of the act described in the text."
