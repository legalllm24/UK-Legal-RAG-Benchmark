There are no irrelevant statements.,1.0,The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions.,0.8069444444444445,"The score is 0.81 because the first five nodes in the retrieval context are highly relevant, directly addressing the legal protections and steps to ensure safety under the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, as stated in their reasons.  However, the sixth and seventh nodes are irrelevant, referring to the wrong act ('This is an explanatory note related to the Stalking Protection Act 2019, which is not the relevant act in this case. The note mentions the year 2020, which has no bearing on the 2022 Northern Ireland Act.' and 'This excerpt from the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 lists offences, but doesn't provide the detail required to answer the question about legal protections and steps under the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022.'), which pulls the score down slightly. The remaining nodes are relevant and further explain the details about the process of applying for a Stalking Protection Order.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are perfectly supported by information present in the nodes in retrieval context.  Each sentence finds a direct match or strong alignment with the content of the Protection from Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022, as detailed across multiple nodes. For example, sentence 1 is supported by node 1's reference to the act, sentence 2 aligns with section 1's definition in multiple nodes, and sentences regarding SPOs (4, 5, 6) align with sections 7 and 9, respectively, across multiple nodes.  The final advice (sentences 8 and 9) is also implied across numerous nodes.  Simply put, the entire expected output is accurately reflected in the retrieval context.",0.1111111111111111,"The score is 0.11 because the output largely aligns with the provided context regarding Northern Ireland's stalking legislation, accurately reflecting details on relevant acts, sections, and procedures.  However, a minor discrepancy exists as the context mentions the Stalking Protection Act 2019 (which may not apply to Northern Ireland), while the output focuses solely on Northern Ireland's legislation, leading to a slightly elevated hallucination score."
