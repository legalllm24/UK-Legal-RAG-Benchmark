(ninth node), lowers the overall contextual precision.  The ranking of these irrelevant nodes could be improved, resulting in a higher contextual precision score.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are perfectly and concisely summarized by the nodes in the retrieval context.  Each sentence's content is directly supported by specific sections detailed in the nodes (e.g., sentence 1-3 by node 4, sentence 4-5 by node 2, sentence 6-7 by node 6, sentence 8 by nodes 7 and 8, and sentence 9 by the overall context of the nodes).  Fantastic work!",0.1,"The score is 0.10 because the output largely aligns with the provided context on the Stalking Protection Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, covering key aspects like applications, relevant legislation, and safety advice. However, a minor contradiction exists as the output emphasizes individual actions more than the specific legal regulations detailed in the context's explanatory note."
