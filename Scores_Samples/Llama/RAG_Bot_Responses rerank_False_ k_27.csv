0.8,"The score is 0.80 because the response correctly addresses the tenant's rights and the validity of the notice under the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, but includes irrelevant information about the Private Tenancies (Scotland) Act 2016 and fixed-term tenancies, which are not applicable to the scenario.",1.0,The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions.,0.4880952380952381,"The score is 0.49 because the first node in retrieval context is highly relevant, mentioning 'Article 14 of the Private Tenancies (Northern Ireland) Order 2006' and 'Section 11 of the 2022 Act', directly addressing the input's question about eviction notice periods in Northern Ireland.  The eighth node is also relevant, referring to 'Schedule 2, related to landlord's notice and variation of private tenancy under the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022', providing contextually relevant information. The fourteenth node discusses landlord's notice requirements, adding further context. However, the score is not higher because many irrelevant nodes discussing 'emergency period modifications' (second, third, and fourth nodes), 'regulations related to evictions in England' (fifth, sixth, and seventh nodes), or other irrelevant aspects of the Northern Ireland or other regions' tenancy laws (nodes 9-25) are ranked higher than these relevant nodes.  These irrelevant nodes, with reasons such as 'temporary modifications that do not apply',  'different legal framework (Wales)', and 'not directly related to the question about eviction notice validity', significantly lower the contextual precision score.  If these irrelevant nodes were ranked lower, the score would be higher. ",0.8888888888888888,"The score is 0.89 because sentences 1-8 in the expected output are strongly supported by information in node(s) in retrieval context, while sentence 9 lacks support from the retrieval context.",1.0,"The hallucination score is 1.00 because the actual output incorrectly applies the Private Tenancies (Scotland) Act 2016 to Northern Ireland, ignoring the relevant Northern Ireland legislation (Private Tenancies (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 and Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022) and their associated details regarding notice periods, eviction circumstances, and other crucial aspects.  Numerous key details from the provided contexts are completely missing from the output."
1.0,The score is 1.00 because the response directly and completely addresses the prompt's request for legal protections and steps to take under the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 for a victim of stalking.,1.0,The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions.,0.7294603255149364,"The score is 0.73 because the most relevant nodes in the retrieval context, namely those explaining the Northern Ireland Stalking Act 2022 and its application (first node, second node, fourth node, fifth node, eighth node, ninth node, tenth node, thirteenth node, fourteenth node, seventeenth node, twentieth node, twenty-fourth node and twenty-fifth node), are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes which refer to other acts such as the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 (third node and seventh node), the Stalking Protection Act 2019 (sixth node, sixteenth node, and nineteenth node and twenty-first node), and the Protection from Harassment (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 (twelfth node and twenty-third node).  However, some irrelevant nodes related to different acts are interspersed among the relevant ones, lowering the overall score. For example, the irrelevant nodes discussing the 1997 and 2019 acts appear at ranks three, six, seven, twelve, sixteen, nineteen, twenty-one, and twenty-three.  This interspersing reduces the contextual precision, as perfectly precise results would only have the relevant nodes ranked higher.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the expected output is perfectly summarized by the provided nodes in the retrieval context.  Each sentence in the expected output is accurately reflected in the information presented in the specified nodes.  For example, sentences 1-4 align with node 6, sentences 5-7 with nodes 7 and 8, sentence 8 with the overall context of the act (though section 9 is not directly quoted), and sentences 9 and 10 align with the overall purpose and implications of the act.",0.0,"The score is 0.00 because the actual output aligns perfectly with the provided context, showing no contradictions and accurately reflecting all relevant information."
