It correctly explains the invalidity of the four-week notice (sentences 4, 7) and the tenant's right to remain (sentence 5). However, the mention of potential legal remedies beyond the scope of the tenancy legislation (sentence 8) is not explicitly supported by the nodes in retrieval context, hence the score is not 1.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the actual output hallucinates by discussing the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016 and the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, which are entirely unrelated to the provided context focusing on the Private Tenancies (Coronavirus Modifications) Act (Northern Ireland) 2020, related regulations, and the Private Tenancies (Northern Ireland) Order 2006.

For example, the fifth node is ranked higher than the second node which describes 'This part of the document describes ""Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs)"" and the process of applying for them, which is a crucial legal protection mentioned in the expected output'.  The tenth and eleventh nodes, mentioning 'This section mentions the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, which is not directly relevant to the specific question about the Protection from Stalking Act (NorthernIreland) 2022', and 'This is the title of the Act and does not provide any specific legal information.', also appear later in the ranking than some of the relevant nodes.
