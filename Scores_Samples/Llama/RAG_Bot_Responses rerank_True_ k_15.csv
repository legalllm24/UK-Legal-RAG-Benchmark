It does not contain information relevant to the notice periods under the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 for non-emergency situations.', the second node is irrelevant as 'Similar to the previous document, this focuses on extending the emergency period related to COVID-19 and tenant evictions, not the standard notice periods under the 2022 Act.', the third node is irrelevant as 'This also deals with the extension of the emergency period for tenant evictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is not applicable to the current case which involves a standard eviction notice under the 2022 act.', the fourth node is irrelevant as 'This document pertains to rent variation notices and does not discuss notice periods for evictions under the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022.', the fifth node is irrelevant as 'This fragment focuses on notices for private tenancies granted before a specific date and providing landlords with 28 days to give certain notices. It does not address the notice period for evictions under the 2022 act.', and the sixth node is irrelevant as 'This schedule is about landlord’s notice relating to variation of private tenancy, which is not directly relevant to the question regarding the validity of an eviction notice under the 2022 Act.'",0.7777777777777778,"The score is 0.78 because sentences 1-6 accurately reflect the information about the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022 and its amendments to the 2006 Order, particularly Article 14, regarding notice periods (node(s) in retrieval context) for tenancies exceeding 12 months but under 3 years.  However, sentences 7 and 8, discussing potential legal remedies and broader Northern Ireland housing/civil law protections, lack direct support within the provided node(s) in retrieval context.",0.14285714285714285,"The score is 0.14 because the output aligns well with several provided contexts regarding tenant rights and the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, particularly concerning the 28-day notice period.

0.6060606060606061,"The score is 0.61 because while the response correctly identifies relevant legal protections under the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, it includes numerous irrelevant details about the model's internal processes and generation statistics, which detract from the overall clarity and focus on the legal question.  The core legal information is present, but the extraneous details reduce the score.",1.0,The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions.,0.9166666666666666,"The score is 0.92 because the first four nodes in the retrieval context are highly relevant, providing details on 'acts associated with stalking', 'Stalking Protection Orders', and the 'offence of stalking' under the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, directly addressing the query. However, the last three nodes, ranked 5th, 6th, and 7th, are less relevant, as they either mention the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 instead of the requested Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, or only provide the act's title and purpose without specific details on legal protections or actions for safety.  The lower ranking of these irrelevant nodes compared to the highly relevant ones contributes to the high contextual precision score of 0.92.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are perfectly supported by information found in the nodes in retrieval context.  Specifically, sentence 1 is supported by information across multiple nodes about the Protection from Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022; sentence 2 aligns with node 4's details on Section 1; sentence 3 matches penalties described in node 4; sentence 4 directly relates to Section 7 (node 2) about SPOs; sentence 5 is supported by information in Sections 7 (node 2) and 6 (node 1); sentence 6 is consistent with Section 7 (node 2) subsection (3); sentence 7 aligns with the implications of Section 9, even though the section is not explicitly mentioned; sentence 8 is a logical consequence of the information about the Act and SPOs; and sentence 9 is a reasonable and implicit conclusion based on the context.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the actual output lacks specific details about the legal definitions and application processes of stalking protection orders as detailed in the provided Acts, focusing instead on general advice for victims.
