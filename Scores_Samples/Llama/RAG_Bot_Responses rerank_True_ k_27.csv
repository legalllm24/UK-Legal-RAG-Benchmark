The low score reflects the poor ranking of relevant information regarding the 'Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022'.",0.7777777777777778,"The score is 0.78 because the retrieval context nodes partially support the expected output.  Nodes 1, 2, and 3 discuss relevant legislation (although not the exact 2022 Act) and notice periods, supporting sentences 1-3 and the overall theme. However, the lack of direct mention of the specific 4-month notice period from the 2022 Act in those nodes, combined with the absence of information regarding the tenant's rights (sentence 4) or available legal remedies (sentence 8) in the retrieval context, results in a score below 1.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the actual output is entirely unrelated to the provided contexts.  The output focuses solely on the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 and a two-month notice period, while the contexts discuss various regulations, acts, and amendments concerning notice periods of different lengths and in relation to situations not covered by the cited act. There is no overlap in subject matter."

Similarly, node 9 discusses an amendment to a different act (the 2019 Act) and node 12 refers to the 'Protection from Harassment Act 1997', showing that while many relevant nodes are ranked correctly, some irrelevant nodes are not sufficiently ranked lower, leading to a contextual precision score of 0.72.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the expected output is perfectly summarized by the provided nodes in the retrieval context.  Every sentence in the expected output is supported by information found in the node(s) in retrieval context, aligning with the specifics of the Protection from Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022, including sections 1, 6, 7, and 9.
