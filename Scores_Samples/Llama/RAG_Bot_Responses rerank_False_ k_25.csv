0.9473684210526315,"The score is 0.95 because the response almost perfectly answers the query about bereavement leave and pay in Northern Ireland, but contains a generic statement about the AI's internal processes that is irrelevant to the user's question.",1.0,The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions.,0.7206212577197482,"The score is 0.72 because the first four nodes in the retrieval context provide highly relevant information about the ""Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NorthernIreland) 2022"", directly addressing the user's query.  However, the next four nodes (ranked 5-8) are irrelevant, as they only mention ""textual amendments and revocation of regulations"", offering no relevant information. This is followed by a mix of relevant and irrelevant nodes, with irrelevant nodes ranked lower in general, but still present within the top 20 results.  The presence of several irrelevant nodes, especially those grouped together, decreases the overall precision score, even if many relevant nodes correctly rank higher.  For example, the highly relevant information in node 4, detailing ""two weeks' leave"" and ""conditions for entitlement"", should have been ranked significantly higher than the irrelevant nodes, which only show ""textual amendments"".

For example, the second node, which discusses 'amendments to Article 14 but doesn't specify the notice period', is ranked higher than several relevant nodes.
