The discrepancies are significant and widespread, resulting in a high hallucination score."
0.9,"The score is 0.90 because the response accurately addresses the tenant's rights and the validity of the notice under the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, but includes an introductory statement describing the model and its parameters which is not directly relevant to the legal question asked.",1.0,The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions.,0.0,"The score is 0.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input.  The first node is irrelevant because ""This document discusses emergency period notice modifications, which are not directly relevant to the tenant's situation outside of the emergency period."" The second node is irrelevant because ""This document pertains to landlord's notice regarding tenancy variation, not termination, hence it is not directly relevant."" The third node is irrelevant because ""This focuses on notice regarding certain past matters, not eviction notices, hence it is irrelevant to the question."" The fourth node is irrelevant because ""This excerpt discusses notice periods for periodic standard contracts, not periodic tenancies under the Northern Ireland Act, thus it is irrelevant."" The fifth node is irrelevant because ""This is about notice periods for periodic standard contracts in a different context than the question, thus it is not relevant."" The sixth node is irrelevant because ""This excerpt discusses when a rent variation notice ceases to have effect, which is not directly relevant to the eviction notice scenario."" The seventh node is irrelevant because ""This excerpt discusses notice periods for periodic standard contracts, unrelated to the Northern Ireland Private Tenancies Act."" The eighth node is irrelevant because ""This section describes a notice for tenants about the granting of a tenancy, which is unrelated to the current eviction scenario."" The ninth node is irrelevant because ""This is an explanatory note about landlord notices, offering no specific information about the relevant act."" The tenth node is irrelevant because ""This excerpt discusses the time limit for withdrawal notice by joint contract-holders, not applicable to this situation."" The eleventh node is irrelevant because ""This excerpt is about the time limit for withdrawal notice by joint contract-holders, not relevant to this case."" The twelfth node is irrelevant because ""This excerpt concerns notice of withdrawal of a landlord's termination notice for periodic standard contracts, not relevant to the question.""",0.8,"The score is 0.80 because sentences 1-7 accurately reflect the legal requirements of notice periods under the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, aligning with information across multiple nodes in retrieval context, particularly regarding amendments to Article 14 of the 2006 Order. However, sentences 8 and 9, which discuss legal remedies beyond notice periods, are not fully supported by the retrieval context, which primarily focuses on the specific legal requirements of the act and order, lacking detailed information on broader Northern Ireland housing or civil law protections.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the actual output hallucinates a one-month minimum notice period not supported by the contexts, and it fails to address numerous other relevant details about various notice periods and landlord-tenant procedures present in the provided contexts."
1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the response directly and completely addresses the user's query regarding legal protections and steps for safety under the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, demonstrating a perfect understanding of the relevant law and providing comprehensive and helpful information.

However, the irrelevant nodes discussing the ""Protection from Harassment Act 1997"" (third and seventh node) and the ""Stalking Protection Act 2019"" (sixth node) are ranked too high, pulling the score down.  For example, the explanation in the third node that it is a 'different piece of legislation' should have caused it to be ranked lower. Similarly, the sixth node's reference to the wrong year should have resulted in a lower ranking.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are perfectly supported by the information present in the nodes in retrieval context.  Each sentence, from the Act's definition of stalking (sentences 1-4, supported by nodes 1 and 9) to the details of Stalking Protection Orders (sentences 5-9, supported by nodes 7 and 8), and concluding advice (sentences 10-11, supported by the overall context), finds complete corroboration within the specified nodes.
