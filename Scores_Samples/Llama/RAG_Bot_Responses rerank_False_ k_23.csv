The lower-ranked irrelevant nodes (twentieth, twenty-first, twenty-second, and twenty-third) further reduce the score because they focus on unrelated topics or aspects, like agricultural workers or only focusing on pay instead of the leave itself. This indicates that while relevant information is present, its ranking is not optimal, hence the score is not higher.",0.8333333333333334,"The score is 0.83 because sentences 1-5 accurately reflect information from node(s) in retrieval context 4 and 5 regarding parental bereavement leave and pay entitlements under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, including definitions, leave duration, and flexibility.  Sentences 6 and 7 align with information in node(s) 4 and 7 concerning multiple child losses and employment rights during leave. However, sentence 8 about internal employer processes is unsupported by the retrieval context.",1.0,"The hallucination score is 1.00 because the actual output contains several significant contradictions compared to the provided contexts.  The output incorrectly states the bereavement leave duration (5 days vs. 2 weeks), bereavement pay duration (6 weeks vs. unspecified), and omits crucial details about Northern Ireland legislation.  The output frequently provides generic information, ignoring specific details, dates, and regulation numbers present in the contexts.  In several instances, the output's information is irrelevant or largely inconsistent with the provided regulatory texts."
1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the response directly addresses the question about the validity of the eviction notice under the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 and outlines the tenant's rights, showing complete relevance.",1.0,The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions.,0.4680952380952381,"The score is 0.47 because the first relevant node in retrieval context contains information about Article 14 of the Private Tenancies (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 and how the Act amends this article to set updated notice periods, while many irrelevant nodes, such as the second node, which discusses regulations extending the emergency period for evictions due to the coronavirus pandemic, the third node that also relates to coronavirus-related eviction protections and extensions to emergency periods, the fourth node focusing on coronavirus-related eviction protection extensions, the fifth node pertaining to English regulations regarding eviction protection during the COVID-19 pandemic, the sixth node also concerning COVID-19-related eviction protections in England, the seventh node addressing the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on eviction in England, the eleventh node discussing landlord’s notice of termination for periodic standard contracts in Wales, the twelfth node focusing on rent variation notices, the thirteenth node describing landlord's notice of termination under a periodic standard contract in Wales, the fifteenth node relating to extending the expiry date of regulations concerning protection from eviction during the COVID-19 pandemic in England, the sixteenth node discussing the minimum time for a withdrawal notice by joint contract holders, the seventeenth node concerning restrictions on forfeiture for non-payment of rent in business tenancies, the eighteenth node concerning the prescribed form of a notice of withdrawal of a landlord's notice of termination, the nineteenth node discussing rent increases registered with a rent officer in Northern Ireland, and the twentieth node discussing amendments to regulations concerning prescribed information in notices to quit, are ranked lower.  However, some highly relevant nodes are ranked relatively low, which negatively impacts the score.  For instance, the eighth node, mentioning the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 and Schedule 2, is relevant, but the ranking of several irrelevant nodes before it brings down the overall contextual precision.",0.8888888888888888,"The score is 0.89 because the majority of the expected output (sentences 1-7) aligns perfectly with the information from the first node(s) in retrieval context, covering aspects like notice periods under the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, its amendments to the 2006 Order, and the invalidity of the landlord's short notice.  However, sentence 8, concerning additional legal remedies beyond the specific act, lacks direct support from the provided node(s).",1.0,"The hallucination score is 1.00 because the model's response provides a general overview of Northern Irish tenancy laws, failing to address the specific details present in the provided contexts regarding notice periods, eviction protections, and regulations across different jurisdictions and timeframes.  The mention of a three-month notice period, unsupported by the contexts, further exemplifies this significant factual mismatch."
0.14285714285714285,The score is 0.14 because the response contains only metadata about the model's execution and does not address the legal question regarding stalking protections under the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022.  The response is completely irrelevant to the input.,1.0,The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions.,0.5997421989516851,"The score is 0.60 because while the first two relevant nodes in the retrieval context (the primary legal basis and procedures for stalking protection orders) are ranked higher than most irrelevant nodes, several irrelevant nodes (references to other acts, explanatory notes, and citations) are ranked higher than some relevant nodes. For example, the third node is ranked higher than some relevant nodes even though it refers to the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, which is not the specified act. Similarly, other irrelevant nodes like explanatory notes and citations from other acts are interspersed amongst the relevant ones.  If these irrelevant nodes were ranked lower, the contextual precision would improve.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are perfectly supported by information found in various nodes in the retrieval context.
