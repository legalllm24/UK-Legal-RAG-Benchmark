However, several irrelevant nodes, discussing the coronavirus pandemic's impact on evictions (ranks 2, 3, 4) and regulations in England (ranks 5, 6, 7), are ranked higher than some other relevant nodes.  The later relevant nodes (ranks 8, 9, 10, 14) mention Sections of the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, further supporting the query.  Several other irrelevant nodes focusing on Welsh legislation (ranks 11, 13) and rent variation notices (rank 12) further lower the score, as they are not related to the specific Northern Ireland context and the eviction notice scenario. The final irrelevant node (rank 15) mentions landlord's notice information without specifying the notice period, contributing to the lower score.",0.8888888888888888,"The score is 0.89 because the majority of the expected output (sentences 1-8) aligns perfectly with the information found in the first node in the retrieval context, covering the key aspects of the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 and the required notice periods. However, the final sentence, discussing broader legal protections not detailed in the provided node(s), is unaligned, slightly lowering the overall score.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the actual output fails to address the specifics of the provided contexts. It offers a general overview of the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, without analyzing individual contexts for alignment or contradiction.  Many contexts discuss specific regulations, schedules, and articles within the Act or related legislation which are not addressed in the output.  Furthermore, some contexts refer to English regulations, irrelevant to the Northern Ireland Act discussed in the output."
1.0,The score is 1.00 because the response directly addresses the user's question about legal protections and steps to take under the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 for a victim of stalking.  There are no irrelevant statements.,1.0,The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions.,0.7644423758060122,"The score is 0.76 because the relevant nodes (nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14 providing information about the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022) are ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes (nodes 3, 6, 7, 12 providing information on the 1997 Protection from Harassment Act or the 2019 Stalking Protection Act).  However, some irrelevant nodes are interspersed among the relevant ones; for example, the third node is irrelevant, stating that ""This refers to the Protection from Harassment Act 1997"", and the sixth node, stating ""This explanatory note refers to a different Act (Stalking Protection Act 2019)"", and the seventh node, stating ""This section refers to offences under the 1997 Protection from Harassment Act"", and the twelfth node, stating ""This refers to the Protection from Harassment (Northern Ireland) Order 1997"", are all ranked higher than some relevant ones.  This ranking reduces the contextual precision score to 0.76.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are perfectly supported by information found in the nodes in retrieval context, covering all aspects of the Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, from definitions and penalties to SPOs and reporting procedures.  The information alignment is excellent!",0.06666666666666667,"The score is 0.07 because the model largely aligns with the context in explaining the Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 and related procedures, but shows a minor contradiction by focusing on the 2022 Northern Ireland Act rather than the mentioned 2019 Stalking Protection Act."
