1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the response directly addresses the question about the validity of the eviction notice under the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 and explains the tenant's rights, showing complete relevancy and accuracy.",1.0,The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions.,0.125,"The score is 0.12 because all the first seven nodes in retrieval context are irrelevant, as the first seven nodes focus on COVID-19 emergency periods and rent variation notices, not the 'validity of an eviction notice under the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022'. Only the eighth node in retrieval context is relevant, mentioning 'Article 14 of the Private Tenancies (Northern Ireland) Order 2006', which is related to eviction notices, but indirectly.  This low ranking of the relevant node compared to many irrelevant nodes results in a low contextual precision score.",0.7777777777777778,"The score is 0.78 because the first six sentences align well with node(s) in retrieval context, accurately reflecting the legal requirements for notice periods under the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 and the related amendments to the 2006 Order. However, the final two sentences, concerning potential legal remedies beyond the scope of the specific tenancy legislation, are not sufficiently supported by the retrieval context and reduce the overall score.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the actual output significantly deviates from the provided contexts, focusing on post-emergency notice requirements not explicitly mentioned in any context.  The contexts primarily discuss emergency period extensions and notice requirements within those periods, which are not addressed by the output."
1.0,The score is 1.00 because the response directly addresses the user's query about legal protections and safety measures under the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 for a victim of stalking in Northern Ireland.  It provides relevant information and is completely on-point.,1.0,The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions.,0.8303571428571428,"The score is 0.83 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than the irrelevant ones.  For example, the first node explains ""acts associated with stalking"", which is highly relevant. The second node describes ""Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs)"", a key legal protection. The fourth node defines the offence of stalking under the relevant act. The seventh node confirms the relevance of the legal documents. However, the third node, discussing the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, is irrelevant, as is the fifth node, explaining the commencement of sections of the act, and the sixth node which discusses amendments to criminal legal aid regulations. The eighth node is also irrelevant as it mentions the Protection from Harassment Act 1997.  These irrelevant nodes are ranked lower than the relevant ones, contributing to the precision score of 0.83.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are perfectly explained by the provided nodes in the retrieval context.  Specifically, sentences 1-5 accurately reflect sections 1, 7, and 9 of the Protection from Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022, as detailed in the nodes.  The final sentence, advising victims to report incidents and seek help, is also implicitly supported by the Act's provisions for protection and legal recourse described across the nodes.",0.125,"The score is 0.12 because the output aligns well with the context regarding the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 and the Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022,  but omits details about regulation 9 of the Criminal Legal Aid (General) Regulations 2013 mentioned in the context."
