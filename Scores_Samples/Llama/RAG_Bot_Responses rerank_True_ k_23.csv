While the legal information itself might be accurate and relevant, the inclusion of extraneous details lowers the overall score.",1.0,The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions.,0.7635281385281385,"The score is 0.76 because the first two nodes in the retrieval context precisely address the question about legal protections under the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, defining ""acts associated with stalking"" and detailing ""Applications for orders"", specifically Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs).  However, several irrelevant nodes, such as the third node which mentions the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 but lacks details on the 2022 Northern Ireland Act, and the fifth node, which is an explanatory note about the act's implementation instead of directly addressing legal protections and safety steps, were ranked higher than other relevant ones.  The seventh node, discussing criminal legal aid, and the tenth node, again referencing the 1997 Act, also shouldn't have been ranked higher than, for example, the fourth node which defines the ""Offence of stalking"" under the 2022 act and specifies penalties. These irrelevant nodes negatively impacted the precision score, despite the overall inclusion of many pertinent documents.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are perfectly supported by the provided context, with each sentence aligning precisely with relevant sections of the Protection from Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022.  Specifically, sentences 1-6 directly reference sections 1, 7, and 9 of the Act, demonstrating a clear and accurate understanding of the legal framework.  The final two sentences offer practical advice that complements the legal information, strengthening the overall quality of the response.",0.0,"The score is 0.00 because the actual output aligns perfectly with the provided context, showing no contradictions."
