However, several irrelevant nodes discussing only textual amendments and revocation of regulations are ranked lower, but they should be ranked significantly lower than the highly relevant nodes. For example, the fifth node, ranked fifth,  'only mentions textual amendments and revocation of regulations, offering no information on employee rights regarding bereavement leave,' whereas the first node, ranked first, explains that 'the regulations provide for a statutory entitlement to parental bereavement leave for employees following the death of a child, which directly addresses the query.'

For example, the second, third, and fourth nodes are all ranked higher than several relevant ones and contain information about extending emergency periods, which is not directly related to the question about eviction notice periods. Similarly, the fifth, sixth, and seventh nodes, ranked relatively high, discuss regulations preventing eviction attendance, which is also irrelevant.  The low score reflects this lower ranking of relevant nodes compared to the many irrelevant ones discussing topics like emergency period extensions and restrictions on eviction attendance, including those notes explaining that they do not 'contain information about the notice period for tenants under periodic tenancies' and others stating their irrelevance to the 'specific legal notice period question'.  The lower ranking of the relevant nodes compared to these irrelevant nodes in the retrieval context results in a lower contextual precision score.",0.875,"The score is 0.88 because sentences 1-7 in the expected output align well with the information about notice periods and legal requirements under the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, as found in node(s) in retrieval context.

It sets the framework for legal protections and procedures.', and the fourth node that explains 'the rules and procedures for applications for stalking protection orders under the 2022 Act', are ranked highly, several irrelevant nodes discussing other acts like the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 (third and seventh nodes), the Stalking Protection Act 2019 (sixth and nineteenth nodes), and other irrelevant explanatory notes (second and sixteenth nodes) are ranked higher than some relevant ones.  The lower ranking of some relevant nodes, such as the definition of stalking offenses (tenth node) and the application process for Stalking Protection Orders (eighth node), pulls the score down.
