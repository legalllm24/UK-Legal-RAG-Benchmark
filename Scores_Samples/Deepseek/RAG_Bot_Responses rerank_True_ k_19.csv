This low score reflects that a significant portion of the top-ranked nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the question. For example, the first node is irrelevant because ""This document discusses an extension of the emergency period for tenants during the COVID-19 pandemic and doesn't address the specifics of the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 regarding notice periods."" while the seventh node is relevant, but only contains a tangential relation to the topic.",0.0,"The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output are supported by the retrieval context.  All sentences describe aspects of the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 and its amendments to the 2006 Order regarding notice periods for tenants,  while the retrieval context is completely unrelated, focusing on different legislation and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Therefore, there is no overlap between the expected output and the nodes in retrieval context.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the model hallucinates information about the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 and minimum notice periods for evicting tenants,  which is not present in any of the provided contexts."
1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the response directly addresses the user's question regarding legal protections and steps to take under the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 for a victim of stalking, offering relevant and comprehensive information.  There are no irrelevant statements.",1.0,The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions.,0.8083333333333332,"The score is 0.81 because the first four nodes in the retrieval context are highly relevant, providing crucial details about the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, such as definitions of stalking, applications for orders, and the offence of stalking itself.  However, the fifth node, while mentioning the commencement of sections of the act, does not directly address the legal protections and steps to take; the seventh node is irrelevant, focusing on Criminal Legal Aid Regulations instead of the relevant act; and the ninth node, although concerning harassment, is not specific to the Northern Ireland Stalking Act 2022.  These irrelevant nodes, ranked lower than the relevant ones, slightly reduce the contextual precision score.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are perfectly supported by the provided legal text, with each sentence's content directly reflecting specific sections (Sections 1, 6, 7, and 9) within the Protection from Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022.  Fantastic job!",0.1111111111111111,"The score is 0.11 because the output aligns well with the overall themes and key aspects of the provided contexts regarding stalking legislation and protection orders, mentioning relevant acts and procedures. However, it lacks the specificity of the provided context, which focuses on numbered sections of legislation, leading to a slightly elevated hallucination score."
