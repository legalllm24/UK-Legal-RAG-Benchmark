The other nodes, however, are irrelevant; the first node discusses rent variation, the second and third discuss 28-day notices unrelated to evictions, the fourth, sixth discuss landlord's notice of termination for periodic standard contracts which do not cover specific notice periods under the 2022 Act, the seventh is an explanatory note lacking eviction notice period information, the eighth concerns withdrawal notices by joint contract-holders unrelated to the 2022 Act, and the ninth discusses unrelated landlord notice obligations.  These irrelevant nodes are ranked higher than the relevant node, resulting in a low contextual precision score.",0.875,"The score is 0.88 because sentences 1-6 accurately reflect the minimum notice period requirements (4 months for tenancies between 12 and 36 months) as detailed in the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 and the 2006 Order, information readily available in multiple nodes in retrieval context.  However, sentence 7, discussing specific injunctions or protections against harassment, lacks support from the provided nodes in retrieval context, which primarily focus on notice periods rather than specific legal remedies for harassment.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the actual output and context discuss completely different aspects of tenancy law. The context focuses on various legal processes related to rent and lease agreements, including rent variation notices and lease enfranchisement, while the actual output centers on eviction notices under a specific Northern Ireland Act.  There is no overlap in the legal processes discussed."
1.0,The score is 1.00 because the response directly and completely addresses the user's query regarding legal protections and steps to take under the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 for an individual experiencing harassment and stalking from an ex-partner.  There are no irrelevant statements.,1.0,The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions.,0.7321428571428571,"The score is 0.73 because the first two nodes in retrieval context directly address the query by detailing ""acts associated with stalking"" and ""Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs)"" under the Northern Ireland Stalking Act 2022.  However, the subsequent irrelevant nodes, such as the third node which refers to the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, and the fourth and fifth nodes which provide only explanatory notes or preambles, are ranked higher than some of the relevant later nodes (eg. the seventh and eighth nodes describing application procedures and additional SPO details).  If those irrelevant nodes were ranked lower, the score would be higher.",0.875,"The score is 0.88 because the summary accurately reflects most aspects of the Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, aligning with information from nodes in the retrieval context.  Sentences 2-7 strongly correlate with details found within the first and second nodes, particularly sections 6 and 7, covering definitions of stalking, penalties, and Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs).  However, sentence 1 offers a general overview not directly supported by specific sections in any nodes.",0.1111111111111111,"The score is 0.11 because the model largely aligns with the provided contexts regarding the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 and its use of Stalking Protection Orders, although a key contradiction exists: the model focuses on the Northern Ireland Act of 2022, while the provided text mentions a different act, the 2019 Stalking Protection Act."
