0.9,"The score is 0.90 because the response accurately addresses the validity of the eviction notice and the tenant's rights under the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, but contains a minor, irrelevant transitional statement.",1.0,The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions.,0.1111111111111111,"The score is 0.11 because all the first eight nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input; for example, the first node is irrelevant because 'This document discusses extending the emergency period for evictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is irrelevant to the question regarding the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022.', the second node is irrelevant because 'Similar to the previous document, this one also focuses on extending the emergency period for evictions during the pandemic, not on the specific requirements of the 2022 Act.', and the third node is irrelevant because 'This document is also about extending the emergency period for evictions during the COVID-19 pandemic and does not contain information about the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022.'.  Only the ninth node is relevant, mentioning 'Article 14 of the Private Tenancies (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 (length of notice to quit)', but its lower rank significantly impacts the contextual precision score.",0.8888888888888888,"The score is 0.89 because the majority of the expected output aligns well with information from nodes in retrieval context, particularly regarding the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, the 2006 Order, and the required notice periods (sentences 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7).  However, the discussion of specific legal remedies in the final sentence is unsupported by the provided nodes.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the actual output hallucinates a four-week notice period for evictions, which contradicts all provided contexts.  The contexts discuss 12-week notice periods, extensions of emergency periods, rent variation notices, and other unrelated legal provisions, none of which support the output's claim."
1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the response directly addresses the user's question about legal protections and safety measures under the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, providing relevant and accurate information.",1.0,The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions.,0.7229024943310656,"The score is 0.72 because while the first four nodes in the retrieval context are highly relevant, accurately addressing the legal protections and steps available under the Northern Ireland Stalking Act 2022, as explained in their reasons, such as defining ""acts associated with stalking"", detailing Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs), and defining the offense of stalking; several irrelevant nodes discussing other acts, like the 1997 Protection from Harassment Act or the 2023 Protection from Sex-based Harassment in Public Act, appear later than expected, reducing the score.  Specifically, the third node, focusing on the 1997 Act instead of the relevant 2022 Act, the fifth node, being an explanatory note that doesn't directly address legal protections, the sixth node, concerning a different act entirely, the eighth node which discusses legal aid regulations unrelated to the 2022 Act, and the eleventh node, again referencing the 1997 Act, are all ranked lower than several relevant nodes.  If these irrelevant nodes were placed lower, the score would have improved.  ",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are perfectly supported by information found in the nodes in retrieval context.  Specifically, sentences 1-7 directly correlate with sections 1, 6, 7, and 9 of the Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, with strong support from the first, second, and third nodes in the retrieval context. Sentences 8 and 9, though not directly quoted, align with the overall purpose and implications of the Act, making this a comprehensive and accurate summary!",0.0,"The score is 0.00 because the actual output aligns perfectly with the provided context, showing no contradictions or hallucinations.
