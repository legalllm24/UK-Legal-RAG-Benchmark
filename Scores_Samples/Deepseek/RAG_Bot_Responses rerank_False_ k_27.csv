While some aspects align (choosing between statutory and contractual rights), the major discrepancies significantly impact the accuracy, leading to a high hallucination score."
1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the response directly addresses the question regarding the validity of the eviction notice and the tenant's rights under the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, providing a complete and relevant answer.",1.0,The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions.,0.7380952380952381,"The score is 0.74 because the two most relevant nodes in the retrieval context, the first and second nodes, correctly identify and explain the amendment to Article 14 of the 2006 Order, which is key to answering the question about the validity of the 4-week notice.  However, several irrelevant nodes, such as the third node focusing on ""emergency periods and temporary modifications due to the Coronavirus pandemic"", and many others discussing COVID-19 related eviction protections, are ranked higher than expected.  These irrelevant nodes, including those ranked from the third to the twentieth and beyond, contain information unrelated to standard notice periods under the 2022 Act.  The presence of these irrelevant nodes at higher ranks reduces the contextual precision score. For example, the fifth node mentions ""regulations extending the emergency period for evictions due to COVID-19"", while the seventh node discusses ""regulations related to COVID-19 and eviction protection"", making them less relevant compared to the first two nodes that directly address the tenant's situation and the 4-week notice validity. While several other nodes are partially relevant, such as the fourteenth node ('This document discusses providing notice relating to the granting of a tenancy and any variation, indirectly relevant to the time frame question'), their lower direct relevance compared to the first two nodes results in a score of 0.74.",0.8888888888888888,"The score is 0.89 because the majority of the expected output (sentences 1-8) aligns perfectly with the information in node(s) in retrieval context, specifically detailing the legal notice periods under the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022 and its amendments to the 2006 Order.  However, sentence 9, discussing additional legal remedies beyond those explicitly mentioned in the node(s), contributes to a slight deduction in the score.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the model failed to address the specifics of the provided contexts, focusing instead on a single, generalized scenario.  The contexts required a detailed analysis of various legal regulations and explanatory notes, which the model omitted."
