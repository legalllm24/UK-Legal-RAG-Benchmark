For example, the irrelevant node mentioning the ""Protection from Harassment Act 1997"" (node 3) is ranked higher than some relevant nodes that discuss Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs) and their application (nodes 6 and 10). Similarly, an irrelevant explanatory note about the Act's commencement (node 5) is ranked higher than a relevant node defining the offense of stalking (node 4).  This ranking inconsistency results in a score below 1.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are perfectly supported by information present in the node(s) in retrieval context.  The details regarding the definition of stalking (sentence 1, node 1), penalties (sentence 3, node 1), Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs) (sentences 4-6, node 1), and advice for victims (sentences 7-8, node 1) all align precisely with the content of the relevant sections of the act.  This perfect match results in a contextual recall score of 1.00!",0.1,"The score is 0.10 because the output largely aligns with the provided context regarding legal protections against stalking, including mentions of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 and relevant legal processes. However, the omission of specific details like commencement information and section numbers from the context contributes to a slightly elevated hallucination score."
