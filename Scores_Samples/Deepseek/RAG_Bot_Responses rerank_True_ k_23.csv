The second node, third node, fourth node, fifth node, sixth node, seventh node and eighth node also discuss topics unrelated to the question, such as rent variation notices and amendments to regulations. Only the ninth node is relevant, mentioning Article 14 of the Private Tenancies (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 and changes to eviction notice periods. The tenth and eleventh nodes are also irrelevant.  The low score reflects the fact that many irrelevant nodes are ranked higher than the single relevant node.",0.875,"The score is 0.88 because sentences 1-6 accurately reflect information about the notice periods and legal requirements under the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, aligning with details from node(s) in retrieval context.  However, sentence 7, concerning specific injunctions or harassment protections, lacks direct support from the provided nodes.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the actual output is completely unrelated to all eleven provided contexts.  The output discusses the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, while the contexts cover various unrelated topics, including COVID-19 emergency rental periods, different aspects of tenancy law, and regulations specific to other jurisdictions (Wales).  There is no factual alignment; all comparisons show contradictions."
1.0,The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the query by outlining the legal protections available under the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 and suggesting steps for ensuring safety.  There are no irrelevant statements.,1.0,The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions.,0.7726190476190476,"The score is 0.77 because the top-ranked retrieval contexts, which accurately address legal protections under the Stalking Act (NorthernIreland) 2022, such as defining ""acts associated with stalking"" (first node), detailing ""Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs)"" (second node), and outlining the offence of stalking (fourth node), are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes that mention the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 (third and eleventh nodes), or discuss legal aid (seventh node), or only provide contextual information about the Act's enforcement dates (fifth node).  However, some irrelevant nodes are ranked higher than some relevant ones which explains why the score is not higher. For example, the explanatory note on section entry into force (fifth node) is ranked higher than the section outlining court powers to issue Stalking Protection Orders (sixth node).",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are perfectly supported by the information in the nodes in retrieval context.  Specifically, sentences 1-6 directly cite and expand upon details found in various sections of the Protection from Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022 as reflected in the nodes, with sentence 1 referencing node 1, sentences 2 and 3 referencing nodes 1 and 4 and 2 respectively, and sentences 4-6 referencing node 2 and node 10. Sentences 7 and 8 offer practical advice consistent with the overall protective measures outlined across the nodes in retrieval context.",0.09090909090909091,"The score is 0.09 because the actual output largely aligns with the provided context on legal frameworks, protection orders, and victim support,  but omits specific sections (2, 2A, 4, and 4A) of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 mentioned in the context."
