However, the third node, mentioning the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, is irrelevant; as is the sixth node, concerning the Stalking Protection Act 2019, and the seventh, which is an excerpt from an unrelated Act. These irrelevant nodes are ranked lower than most relevant nodes, resulting in a score slightly below 1. The inclusion of multiple relevant nodes about Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs), their application process, and associated definitions, alongside the commencement order, demonstrates significant alignment with the input question, but the presence of irrelevant nodes, while lower ranked, slightly reduces the precision score.",0.9,"The score is 0.90 because the summary accurately reflects the key aspects of the Protection from Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022, with details on stalking definitions (sentence 2, node 9), penalties (sentence 3, node 9), Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs) (sentences 4-6, nodes 7 and 9), and their duration and flexibility (sentences 7-8, nodes 7 and 9).  The advice to report incidents and seek support (sentences 9-10) aligns with the Act's purpose, though it's not explicitly stated in the provided nodes.  Only the introductory sentence (sentence 1) lacks a direct connection to a specific node in retrieval context.",0.09090909090909091,"The score is 0.09 because the model accurately reflects most aspects of the Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 and related legislation, showing strong alignment with the provided context.  A minor discrepancy regarding the commencement date of a related act (Stalking Protection Act 2019) accounts for the small hallucination score."
