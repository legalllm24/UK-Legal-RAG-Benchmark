The output hallucinates details such as specific durations of employment and leave, and incorrectly cites relevant legislation.  There is no alignment between the level of detail and the subject matter of the actual output and the contexts."
1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the response directly addresses the validity of the eviction notice under the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 and outlines the tenant's rights, demonstrating perfect relevancy to the input question.",1.0,The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions.,0.09090909090909091,"The score is 0.09 because all the first ten nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant, focusing on the 2020 Act or other unrelated aspects such as rent variation notices, rent increase notices, and regulations specific to Wales, rather than the required notice periods under the 2022 Northern Ireland Act.  The first relevant node is ranked eleventh, mentioning Article 14 of the 2006 Order, providing some context, but its limited specificity lowers the overall score; while the twelfth and thirteenth nodes are again irrelevant, discussing regulations preventing attendance to execute possession and irrelevant Welsh regulations, respectively.  This shows a significant misranking of relevant vs. irrelevant nodes, resulting in the low contextual precision score.",0.875,"The score is 0.88 because sentences 1-6 accurately reflect the legal requirements of the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, specifically regarding notice periods for tenancies exceeding 12 months but not exceeding 3 years, as detailed in multiple nodes in retrieval context.  However, sentence 7, concerning legal remedies, lacks direct support from the provided nodes in retrieval context, resulting in a slightly reduced score.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the actual output hallucinates information about the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, specifically concerning four-week eviction notices, which is not supported by any of the provided contexts.  The contexts discuss various aspects of tenancy legislation but lack information on the specifics of four-week eviction notices under this Act."
1.0,The score is 1.00 because the response directly addresses the question by outlining legal protections under the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 and suggesting safety measures.  There are no irrelevant statements.,0.9615384615384616,"The score is 0.96 because the actual output incorrectly states a maximum duration of 2 years for protection orders, while the retrieval context indicates that extensions are possible beyond this timeframe if legally justified.",0.7264128728414442,"The score is 0.73 because the first four nodes in the retrieval context are highly relevant, precisely defining key elements like ""acts associated with stalking"", ""Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs)"", the offense of stalking itself, and its penalties, aligning perfectly with the query.  However, several irrelevant nodes, such as the fifth node which is an explanatory note lacking specifics, the sixth node referencing a separate act, the ninth node focusing on legal aid, and the eleventh node simply being the title of the act, are interspersed among relevant ones.  These irrelevant nodes, ranked lower than some relevant ones (like the seventh and eighth nodes which address breaching SPOs and court powers respectively), decrease the score.  The placement of these irrelevant nodes later in the ranking contributes positively to the score, preventing it from being much lower.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the expected output is perfectly summarized by the provided node(s) in retrieval context.  Each sentence in the expected output (1-10) is accurately reflected in the corresponding sections of the retrieval context, showing a complete and precise match.  There are no discrepancies.",0.07692307692307693,"The score is 0.08 because the text largely aligns with the provided contexts, accurately summarizing key aspects of stalking laws and protection orders in Northern Ireland.  A minor discrepancy exists due to the omission of specific details from one referenced regulation."
