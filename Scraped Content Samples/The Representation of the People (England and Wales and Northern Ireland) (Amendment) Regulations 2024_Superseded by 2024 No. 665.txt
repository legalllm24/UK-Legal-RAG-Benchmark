EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations correct an error in the Representation of the People (Franchise Amendment and Eligibility Review) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/1150) (“the 2023 Regulations”) and the Representation of the People (Franchise Amendment and Eligibility Review) (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/1176), by amending the Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001 (S.I. 2001/341) (“the 2001 Regulations”) and the Representation of the People (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2008 (S.I. 2008/1741) (“the 2008 Regulations”) in respect of the requirements for applications related to registration in England and Wales and Northern Ireland respectively.
The 2023 Regulations amended the 2001 Regulations by inserting new regulation 26(1)(fa). Regulation 26(1)(fa) requires an application for registration under section 10ZC of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (c. 2) (“the 1983 Act”), or an application under section 10ZD of that Act for alteration of the address in respect of which a person is registered, that is made by a relevant EU applicant to include an indication as to whether the applicant meets the requirements set out in section 203B of the 1983 Act. Section 203B provides the conditions by which certain citizens of EU member States (other than those member States listed in Schedule 6A to the 1983 Act or Cyprus, Malta or the Republic of Ireland) who are resident in the UK have retained rights related to electoral registration and are therefore entitled to registration as a local government elector in England or to vote in police and crime commissioner elections in Wales.
Regulation 2(2)(b) substitutes the definition of “relevant EU applicant” in regulation 3(1) of the 2001 Regulations. The effect of this is that the requirement to provide the indication as part of such an application does not apply to an applicant who is a citizen of one of those EU member States where the applicant is also a citizen of a member State listed in Schedule 6A to the 1983 Act, a qualifying Commonwealth citizen (see section 4(6) of the 1983 Act) or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland. A person who is a citizen of a member State listed in Schedule 6A to the 1983 Act, a qualifying Commonwealth citizen or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland is entitled to registration as a parliamentary elector in England and Wales, as a local government elector in England and to vote in police and crime commissioner elections in Wales by virtue of that status.
Regulation 3 makes equivalent amendments to regulation 27 of the 2008 Regulations in respect of applications for registration in Northern Ireland under sections 10A(1)(a) or 13A(1)(a) of the 1983 Act.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.
