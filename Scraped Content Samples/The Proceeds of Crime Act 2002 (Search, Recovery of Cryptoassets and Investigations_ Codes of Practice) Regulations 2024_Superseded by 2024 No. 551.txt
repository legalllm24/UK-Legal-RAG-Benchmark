EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations bring into operation two revised codes of practice and one new code of practice issued by the Secretary of State under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (c. 29) (“the 2002 Act”).
They are necessitated by certain amendments made to the 2002 Act by the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022 (c. 10) (“the 2022 Act”) and by the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 (c. 56) (“the 2023 Act”). The amendments made by the 2022 Act concern unexplained wealth orders and the amendments made by the 2023 Act concern cryptoassets.
Regulations 2 and 3 bring into operation, on 26th April 2024:
a revised code of practice relating to the powers of certain officers under Part 2 of the 2002 Act to search for, seize and detain property, including cryptoassets and related items, in England and Wales;
a revised code of practice relating to the investigation powers of certain officers under Chapter 2 of Part 8 of the 2002 Act, including updated provision about unexplained wealth orders, in England and Wales and Northern Ireland;
a new code of practice relating to the powers of certain officers under Part 5 of the 2002 Act to search for, seize and detain cryptoassets and related items, in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Regulation 4 revokes previous instruments which brought into force previous codes of practice.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.
