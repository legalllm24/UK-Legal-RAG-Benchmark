EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order brings into operation on 26th April 2024 a revised code of practice issued by the Secretary of State under the Terrorism Act 2000 (c. 11) in respect of functions conferred by Schedule 1 to the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 (c. 24) (“the 2001 Act”) in relation to terrorist property.

A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.
