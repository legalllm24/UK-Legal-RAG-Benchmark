Household packaging waste disposal fees: modulation
64.—(1) This regulation applies in relation to the calculation of disposal fees payable by liable producers for the 2026 assessment year and subsequent assessment years.
(2) Subject to paragraphs (12)(b) and (13), the scheme administrator must, for each liable producer, modulate in accordance with this regulation the amounts calculated under regulation 62 (“household packaging waste disposal fees”) for each packaging category of household packaging supplied by the producer.
(3) In this regulation, to “modulate” an amount means to—
(a)
apply an increase to the amount;
(b)
apply a reduction to the amount; or
(c)
leave the amount unchanged,
for the purposes in paragraph (4).
(4) Those purposes are—
(a)
to reflect the extent to which household packaging supplied by the producer in the packaging category in question is environmentally sustainable; and
(b)
to incentivize the producer to use packaging which is more environmentally sustainable.
(5) Where the scheme administrator modulates an amount that has been calculated for a liable producer under regulation 62, it must use the modulated amount in calculating the disposal fee payable by the producer.
(6) For the purposes of this regulation, packaging is “environmentally sustainable” if it is designed and manufactured to reduce—
(a)
its impact on the environment; and
(b)
the generation of waste.
(7) In assessing the extent to which household packaging is environmentally sustainable, the scheme administrator must take into account one or more of the following factors—
(a)
whether the packaging is reusable;
(b)
the extent to which the packaging is reused;
(c)
the recyclability of the packaging;
(d)
the environmental impacts of the manufacture, transportation and use of the packaging;
(e)
the environmental impact of the packaging when it becomes waste.
(8) Where a liable producer has not provided sufficient information to enable the scheme administrator to determine for the purposes of paragraph (4)(a) the degree of environmental sustainability of all the household packaging supplied by that producer in a packaging category, the scheme administrator is to treat that packaging as having the same degree of environmental sustainability as the least environmentally sustainable household packaging in that packaging category.
(9) The scheme administrator must, in determining how to modulate a household packaging waste disposal fee, take into account any foreseeable environmental implications of its proposed decision.
(10) Where a household packaging waste disposal fee or part of such a fee relates to medical packaging, the scheme administrator must, in modulating that fee, take into account whether any other legislation which applies to the medical packaging prevents the producer from using, or restricts the ability of the producer to use, more environmentally sustainable packaging.
(11) The scheme administrator may not modulate household packaging waste disposal fees for an assessment year in a way which, taking all those modulations together, has the effect of increasing the total of those fees to an amount which is greater than the total amount of net efficient disposal costs likely to be incurred by relevant authorities in that assessment year in relation to household packaging waste.
(12) The scheme administrator—
(a)
must modulate household packaging waste disposal fees under this regulation in accordance with the statement of policy published by the scheme administrator under paragraph 8 of Schedule 7; and
(b)
may not make any modulations unless it has published that statement.
(13) Where paragraph (14) applies, the scheme administrator may defer starting to modulate household packaging waste disposal fees for online marketplace operators, either for one or more packaging categories or for all packaging categories, until a later assessment year than the 2026 assessment year.
(14) This paragraph applies if—
(a)
the scheme administrator specifies packaging sub-categories for the purposes of paragraph 3 of Schedule 4 in relation to classes of producers other than online marketplace operators; and
(b)
the scheme administrator considers that—
(i)
it would be significantly more burdensome for online marketplace operators than for other classes of producers to be required to collect and report the information referred to in paragraph 3 of Schedule 4 for those packaging sub-categories; and
(ii)
that burden would be disproportionate to the environmental benefit of modulating the fees for online marketplace operators.

Calculation of administration fee
65.—(1) The scheme administrator must, for each assessment year—
(a)
determine its chargeable administration costs, in accordance with paragraph (2); and
(b)
calculate the amount of the administration fee payable by each liable producer, in accordance with paragraph (3).
(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), “chargeable administration costs” means the amount which the scheme administrator considers will enable it—
(a)
to meet the expenses, other than public information disposal costs, that it expects to incur in that assessment year in carrying out its functions or for any incidental purposes;
(b)
to pay any interest on relevant borrowing, and to repay the principal of any relevant borrowing which is repayable during the assessment year; and
(c)
to meet relevant commencement expenses.
(3) The administration fee payable by each liable producer must be calculated as—
where—
“F” is the liable producer’s share of chargeable administration costs, which is to be calculated by dividing the amount determined by the scheme administrator under paragraph (1)(a) between all liable producers in the same proportions as disposal fees are divided between liable producers for that assessment year; and
“G” is the provision for impairments calculated for the liable producer under regulation 66(4)(b).
(4) In paragraph (2)—
“relevant borrowing” means any money borrowed by the scheme administrator which has been used for the purpose of meeting expenses incurred in relation to its assumption or exercise of functions under these Regulations;
“relevant commencement expenses” means expenses incurred by the scheme administrator in preparation for the exercise of its functions under these Regulations.

https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2024/9780348264654/regulation/66
Provision for impairments
66.—(1) The scheme administrator must, for each assessment year, determine the percentage of (A+B), and of F, which is to be added to those amounts as provision for impairments.
(2) In these Regulations, an “impairment” means a fee or part of a fee charged to a liable producer which the scheme administrator is unable to recover, due to the producer’s insolvency or any other reason.
(3) The scheme administrator must make the determination under paragraph (1) in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards(1).
(4) The scheme administrator must calculate, for each liable producer—
(a)
the amount (“C”) to be included in the liable producer’s disposal fee for the assessment year as a provision for impairments, where C is equal to the relevant percentage of (A+B);
(b)
the amount (“G”) to be included in the liable producer’s administration fee for the relevant year as a provision for impairments, where G is equal to the relevant percentage of F.
(5) In this regulation—
“(A+B)” means the sum of A and B, where “A” and “B” have the meanings given in regulation 61;
“F” has the meaning given in regulation 65(3);
“the relevant percentage” means the percentage determined by the scheme administrator under paragraph (1) for the assessment year.

(b)
in assessing, as part of an effectiveness assessment for any assessment year, whether a relevant authority is in a comparable position to other relevant authorities for the purposes of paragraph (3)(e) and (f).
(5) In assessing what amounts to good practice for the purposes of paragraph (3)(f), the scheme administrator may consider local, national or international examples of good practice.
(6) If the scheme administrator assesses that a relevant authority is not providing an effective waste management service it must—
(a)
give notice in writing to the relevant authority, setting out the reasons why the scheme administrator considers that the authority is not providing an effective waste management service;
(b)
provide the relevant authority with a reasonable opportunity to discuss with the scheme administrator—
(i)
the scheme administrator’s assessment;
(ii)
the waste management service being delivered by the relevant authority in relation to packaging waste; and
(iii)
how that service can be improved to make it more effective;
(c)
after complying with sub-paragraphs (a) and (b), propose actions for the relevant authority to take to improve its waste management service so that it is providing an effective waste management service (“improvement actions”).
(7) Paragraph (8) applies if, at the expiry of a period specified by the scheme administrator to the relevant authority when proposing improvement actions, the scheme administrator considers that the relevant authority—
(a)
is still not providing an effective waste management service; and
(b)
is not doing everything the authority can be reasonably expected to do to improve its waste management service in order to provide an effective waste management service.
(8) Where this paragraph applies, the scheme administrator may adjust the chargeable disposal costs of the relevant authority for the following assessment year, by applying to the relevant authority’s net efficient disposal costs a reduction of such percentage as the scheme administrator considers appropriate to take account of the extent to which the waste management service provided by the authority is not an effective one.
(9) But the scheme administrator may not reduce the chargeable disposal costs of a relevant authority for an assessment year to an amount which is less than 80% of its net efficient disposal costs for that year.
(10) Where the scheme administrator reduces a relevant authority’s chargeable disposal costs under paragraph (8), it must calculate—
(a)
the relevant authority’s chargeable disposal costs for each packaging category of household packaging waste that the relevant authority is likely to manage in the assessment year, by applying the percentage reduction determined under paragraph (8) to the relevant authority’s net efficient disposal costs for each such category as calculated under regulation 71(3); and
(b)
the relevant authority’s total chargeable disposal costs, by applying that percentage reduction to the relevant authority’s total net efficient disposal costs as calculated under regulation 71(4).
(11) In this regulation—
(a)
references to providing an effective waste management service are to providing an effective waste management service in relation to household packaging waste; and
(b)
in paragraph (8), “the following assessment year” means the assessment year after the assessment year in which the scheme administrator makes a determination under paragraph (7).

the total chargeable disposal costs of all relevant authorities; and
(ii)
the public information disposal costs of the scheme administrator; or
(d)
reasonably considers on any other ground that there is likely to be such a material difference.
(2) A recalculation of the disposal fee payable by a liable producer for an assessment year is to be carried out by re-making the calculations in regulations 61 to 64 and 66(4)(a) for the producer, taking into account—
(a)
any further information relevant to those calculations which the scheme administrator has received since the producer’s disposal fee for that assessment year was previously calculated, including information relating to—
(i)
the amount of household packaging in each packaging category supplied by the producer, or by all liable producers, in the calendar year ending on the 31st December before the start of the assessment year;

the scheme administrator has recalculated the disposal fee payable by the producer for the assessment year;
(b)
the chargeable administration costs of the scheme administrator for the assessment year are greater or less than previously determined by the scheme administrator;
(c)
the scheme administrator discovers an error in the calculation of the liability of the producer;
(d)
the scheme administrator determines that the total amount of administration fees received or recoverable from all liable producers is likely to be greater or less than the chargeable administration costs of the scheme administrator; or
(e)
the scheme administrator reasonably considers on any other ground that there is likely to be such a material difference.
(4) A recalculation of the administration fee payable by a liable producer is to be carried out by re-making the calculations in regulations 65 and 66(4)(b) for the producer, taking into account—
(a)
any changes since the producer’s administration fee for that assessment year was previously calculated to—
(i)
the disposal fee payable by the producer for the assessment year; or
(ii)
the chargeable administration costs of the scheme administrator for the assessment year;
(b)
the outcome of any complaint or appeal by the producer relating to the calculation of the producer’s administration fee for the assessment year;
(c)
any other matters which the scheme administrator considers relevant.
(5) Where the scheme administrator determines upon a recalculation under this regulation that the amount of the disposal fee or the administration fee which a liable producer is liable to pay in relation to an assessment year is greater or less than the amount previously notified to the producer—
(a)
the scheme administrator must serve on the producer a notice under regulation 82;
(b)
if the producer’s recalculated disposal fee is greater than the amount paid by the producer to the scheme administrator in relation to the assessment year, the producer is liable to pay to the scheme administrator the difference between those amounts;

Recalculations: chargeable disposal costs
80.—(1) The scheme administrator may recalculate the chargeable disposal costs of a relevant authority in relation to an assessment year if the scheme administrator considers that there is likely to be a material difference between that relevant authority’s chargeable disposal costs as previously calculated and those costs as recalculated because the scheme administrator—
(a)
receives further information relating to a matter referred to in paragraph (2)(a);
(b)
discovers an error in the calculation of any element of the chargeable disposal costs in relation to the relevant authority; or
(c)
reasonably considers on any other ground that there is likely to be such a material difference.
(2) A recalculation of the chargeable disposal costs of a relevant authority is to be carried out by re-making the assessments and adjustments in Chapter 4 for that relevant authority, taking into account—

(c)
any other matters which the scheme administrator considers relevant.
(3) Where the scheme administrator determines, upon a recalculation under this regulation, that the amount of a relevant authority’s chargeable disposal costs in relation to an assessment year is greater or less than the amount previously notified to the relevant authority—
(a)
the scheme administrator must give the relevant authority a notice under regulation 83;
(b)
if the relevant authority’s recalculated chargeable disposal costs are greater than the amount paid to the relevant authority in relation to the assessment year, the scheme administrator must increase the amount to be paid to the relevant authority under regulation 76 in the assessment year in which the recalculation is made, or a subsequent assessment year, to cover the difference;
(c)
if the relevant authority’s recalculated chargeable disposal costs are less than the amount paid to the relevant authority in relation to the assessment year, the scheme administrator must deduct the amount of the excess from the amount to be paid to the relevant authority under regulation 76 in the assessment year in which the recalculation is made, or a subsequent assessment year.

(b)
the scheme administrator did not obtain the information earlier because of—
(i)
deliberate action or omission by a producer, or a relevant authority or a person acting on their behalf; or
(ii)
the failure by a producer to comply with its obligations under these Regulations.
(7) Where paragraph (6) applies, the scheme administrator must complete any subsequent recalculation as soon as reasonably practicable after the scheme administrator has obtained the new information.

(2) Where the contravention to which the notice of intent relates is a criminal offence, the enforcement agency may not serve a final notice on the person if the enforcement agency is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the person would not, by reason of any defence, be liable to be convicted of that offence.

(b)
the grounds for imposing the penalty;

EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations impose requirements on producers of packaging who are established in the United Kingdom. They require producers to register with the appropriate agency, to collect and report data in relation to packaging they supply, and to assess the recyclability of packaging they supply. They also require certain producers to meet recycling obligations and to pay annual fees as a contribution to the net costs of local authorities providing a waste management service in relation to household packaging waste, and the costs of providing public information about disposal of packaging waste. They establish a scheme administrator to administer the provisions on disposal costs and to distribute amounts collected from producers. They also regulate compliance schemes which perform obligations on behalf of producers who are scheme members, and reprocessors and exporters of packaging waste.
Part 1 (regulations 1 to 14) contains interpretation and other general provisions. Regulation 13 and Schedule 1 prescribe charges payable for applications and other matters specified in the Regulations.
Part 2 (regulations 15 to 27) contains provision about producers. Chapter 1 specifies the producers, and classes of producers, which may have obligations under these Regulations and, in relation to each class of producer, the packaging in relation to which producers of that class may have obligations. Chapter 2 (regulations 23 to 26) sets out the threshold criteria which determine whether a producer is a large producer or a small producer for the purposes of these Regulations, gives an overview of the producer responsibility obligations of large producers and small producers, and makes provision about assessments of the recyclability of packaging. Chapter 3 (regulation 27) makes provision about the effect of insolvency and other events on a producer’s obligations.
Part 3 (regulations 28 to 41) contains more detailed provisions about producer responsibility obligations. Chapter 1 contains provision about registration of producers. Chapter 2 and Schedule 4 contain provision about record-keeping and reporting obligations. Chapter 3 and Schedule 5 contain provision about recycling and certification obligations.
Part 4 (regulations 42 to 56) contains provision about the obligations of compliance schemes and their operators, including requirements for the approval and registration of such schemes, and about the effect of compliance scheme membership upon a producer’s obligations.
Part 5 (regulations 57 to 83) contains provision about disposal costs and disposal fees. Chapter 1 contains interpretation provisions. Chapter 2 provides for the appointment of a scheme administrator and Schedule 7 makes further provision about the functions of the scheme administrator and the principles it must follow. Chapter 3 makes certain large producers which supply household packaging (“liable producers”) liable to pay disposal fees and administration fees to the scheme administrator and provides for the calculation of those fees. It includes provision for the “modulation” of disposal fees payable by a liable producer (regulation 64), that is, for the scheme administrator to be able to adjust those fees to reflect the extent to which household packaging supplied by the producer is environmentally sustainable, and to incentivize the use of more environmentally sustainable packaging. Chapter 4 makes provision about the assessment by the scheme administrator of the “chargeable disposal costs” of relevant authorities (local authorities with waste collection or disposal functions), that is, the amounts which relevant authorities are entitled to be paid by the scheme administrator out of the disposal fees it collects from liable producers, in respect of the costs those authorities incur in relation to the management of household packaging waste. Chapter 5 provides for the recalculation in certain circumstances of amounts calculated or assessed under Chapters 3 and 4.
Part 6 (regulations 84 to 100) and Schedule 8 regulate reprocessors who recycle packaging waste at reprocessing sites in the United Kingdom and exporters who export packaging waste to be recycled at overseas reprocessing sites. Chapter 1 contains interpretation provisions. Chapter 2 provides for the registration of reprocessors and exporters. Chapter 3 prohibits the issue of PRNs or PERNs (that is, documents which may be used by producers and scheme operators as evidence of compliance with their recycling obligations) by anyone other than a reprocessor or exporter who issues them in accordance with an accreditation granted by the appropriate agency. It makes provision about accreditation and imposes record keeping and reporting requirements on accredited reprocessors and exporters.
In Part 7 (regulations 101 and 102), regulation 101 and Schedule 9 make provision about the application of producer responsibility obligations where two or more members of a corporate group are each a producer, including provision for group registrations. Regulation 102 and Schedule 10 apply certain record-keeping and reporting requirements to licensors and pub operating businesses.
Part 8 (regulations 103 to 108) and Schedule 11 contain provisions about appeals.
Part 9 (regulations 109 to 113) and Schedule 12 contain provisions about monitoring and enforcement by the appropriate agencies.
Part 10 (regulations 114 to 126) and Schedule 13 contain provisions about offences and civil sanctions.
Part 11 (regulations 127 to 140) contain miscellaneous and supplementary provisions. Regulation 137 and Schedule 15 make transitional, transitory and saving provisions. Regulation 139 and Schedule 17 contain revocations.
