EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulations 2 and 3 make amendments to primary legislation that are consequential on the revocation by section 1(1) of, and Schedule 1 to, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 (c. 29) (“FSMA 2023”) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (“the Capital Requirements Regulation”). The amendments in regulations 2 and 3 are made under section 83 of FSMA 2023.
Regulation 2 amends the definition of “CRR Rules” in section 144A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (c. 8). Regulation 3 amends section 5 of the Financial Services Act 2021 (c. 22), which makes provision relating to CRR rules replacing provisions of the Capital Requirements Regulation.
Regulation 4 amends the definition of “recognised exchange” in Article 4 of the Capital Requirements Regulation. This amendment is made under sections 3 and 84(2)(a) of FSMA 2023. The definition of “recognised exchange” is relevant to the calculation of the credit risk exposures of banks and other firms. Certain securities traded on recognised exchanges can be used by banks and those firms as eligible collateral subject to preferential capital treatment. Regulation 4 includes in the definition of “recognised exchange” (i) UK regulated markets, (ii) recognised overseas investment exchanges, and (iii) investment exchanges that meet the conditions specified in rules to be made by the Prudential Regulation Authority. The rules will be published at https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation and will be available from the Prudential Regulation Authority, 20 Moorgate, London EC2R 6DA.
