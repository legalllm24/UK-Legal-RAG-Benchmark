EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Order) 
This Order designates returning officers for constituencies in Scotland that are situated within the 
area of more than one local authority, as the returning officer for these constituencies is not 
prescribed by section 25(1)(a) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (c. 2). 
The Order is in consequence of the new parliamentary constituency boundaries in Scotland set out 
in the Parliamentary Constituencies Order 2023 (S.I. 2023/1230) and does not come fully into force 
until the next parliamentary general election is called.
