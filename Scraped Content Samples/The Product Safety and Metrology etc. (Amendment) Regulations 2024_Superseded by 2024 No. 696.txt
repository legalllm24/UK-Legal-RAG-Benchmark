EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke and replace provisions of the following legislation as they apply in Great Britain (England and Wales and Scotland):
The Noise Emission in the Environment by Equipment for use Outdoors Regulations 2001;
The Supply of Machinery (Safety) Regulations 2008;
The Aerosol Dispensers Regulations 2009;
The Ecodesign for Energy-Related Products Regulations 2010;
The Toys (Safety) Regulations 2011;
The Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Regulations 2012;
The Explosives Regulations 2014;
The Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2015;
The Electromagnetic Compatibility Regulations 2016;
The Simple Pressure Vessels (Safety) Regulations 2016;
The Lifts Regulations 2016;
The Electrical Equipment (Safety) Regulations 2016;
The Pressure Equipment (Safety) Regulations 2016;
The Equipment and Protective Systems Intended for Use in Potentially Explosive Atmospheres Regulations 2016;
The Non-automatic Weighing Instruments Regulations 2016;
The Measuring Instruments Regulations 2016;
The Recreational Craft Regulations 2017;
The Radio Equipment Regulations 2017;
The Personal Protective Equipment (Enforcement) Regulations 2018 and Regulation (EU) 2016/425; and
The Gas Appliances (Enforcement) and Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations 2018 and Regulation (EU) 2016/426.
They also revoke a provision of the Measuring Container Bottles (EEC Requirements) Regulations 1977.
This legislation relates to consumer safety, environmental protection and health and safety and sets out the requirements that products must meet in order to be placed on the market in Great Britain. It is secondary retained EU law within the meaning of section 11(2) of the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act 2023 (c. 28).
The amendments made to each of these pieces of legislation revoke provision that sets out the expiry of provisions which themselves allow obligations in the legislation as it applies in Great Britain to be met by complying with requirements of the corresponding EU law. With the exception of the Measuring Container Bottles (EEC Requirements) Regulations 1977, they replace this provision with provision allowing relevant economic operators to meet any conformity assessment or testing requirements in the legislation as it applies in Great Britain by complying with the corresponding EU conformity assessment or testing requirements.
The Regulations also revoke certain transitional measures which are no longer necessary. The Regulations also amend the definition of some of the EU instruments referred to in the Regulations amended, to remove reference to “IP completion day”. In one case the Regulations replace the definition of the EU instrument so that it refers to the EU instrument as last amended in 2023.
Regulation 23 provides that where a product was in conformity with the Regulations that these Regulations amend when it was first supplied to the market of Great Britain, the changes made by these Regulations do not prevent any further supply of the product and that an obligation to which a person was subject in relation to a product prior to the changes made by these Regulation, continues to apply after the commencement of these Regulations.
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is available from the Trade and Investment Negotiations - Goods Team, Department for Business and Trade, Old Admiralty Building, London SW1A 2AY and is also published with the Explanatory Memorandum alongside this Regulations on www.legislation.gov.uk
