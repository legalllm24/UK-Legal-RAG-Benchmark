EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes changes to electoral arrangements for the district of Tandridge following recommendations made by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England. The area of the district remains unchanged.
Article 3 abolishes the existing electoral wards of the district of Tandridge and replaces them with the 18 new ones listed in Schedule 1 for the purpose of elections held on or after the ordinary day of election of councillors in England in 2024. It also establishes the names and areas of the new electoral wards and the number of councillors for each.
Article 4 makes provision for a whole borough council election in 2024. Subsequently, the council will revert to the existing system of election by thirds. That article also provides for the order of retirement of councillors in 2026, 2027 and 2028 and the election of their replacements.
Articles 5 and 6 make changes to parish wards which are consequential on the changes made by article 3. The changes to parish wards introduced by articles 5 and 6 come into force for the purpose of parish elections in 2024 and 2027 respectively, and in respect of subsequent parish elections.
The area covered by each ward created by this Order is identified on a map which is available for inspection at reasonable times at the offices of the Local Government Boundary Commission for England, 1st Floor, Windsor House, 50 Victoria Street, London SW1H 0TL.
