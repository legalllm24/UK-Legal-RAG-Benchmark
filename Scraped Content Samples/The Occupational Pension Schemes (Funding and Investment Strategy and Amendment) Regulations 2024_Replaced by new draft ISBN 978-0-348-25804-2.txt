Scheme maturity
4.—(1) For the purposes of these Regulations—
(a)
the maturity of a scheme is to be measured in years using a duration of liabilities measure in accordance with paragraphs (2) to (4);
(b)
a scheme reaches significant maturity on the date it reaches the duration of liabilities in years, or such other date, specified by the Regulator in a Code (and the Regulator may specify different durations of liabilities in years or different dates for different descriptions of schemes).
(2) The duration of liabilities measure to be used for the purposes of paragraph (1) is the weighted mean time until the payment of pensions and other benefits under the scheme, weighted by the discounted payments, and, in this regulation, a discounted payment is the present value, at the effective date the duration is calculated, of an expected payment of pension or other benefits, calculated using the assumptions set out in paragraphs (3) and (4).
(3) The actuarial assumptions used for the purposes of paragraph (2) must be actuarial assumptions used in a calculation of the liabilities of a scheme on a low dependency funding basis.
(4) Of the actuarial assumptions used for the purposes of paragraph (2), the economic assumptions must be chosen by reference to the economic circumstances prevailing on 31st March 2023.
(5) In determining the future maturity of a scheme, the trustees or managers of the scheme may take into consideration whether new members may be admitted to the scheme and the future accrual of benefits provided that such assumptions are reasonable and based on an assessment of the financial ability of the employer, in relation to its legal obligations to the scheme, to support the scheme, as assessed by considering the matters set out in regulation 7(4).

Low dependency investment allocation
5.  Low dependency investment allocation means the assets of a scheme are invested in such a way that the value of the assets relative to the value of the scheme’s liabilities is highly resilient to short-term adverse changes in market conditions so that further employer contributions are not expected to be required to make provision for the scheme’s liabilities.

https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2024/9780348256901/regulation/6
Low dependency funding basis
6.—(1) For the purposes of these Regulations, the liabilities of a scheme are calculated on a low dependency funding basis where they are calculated using actuarial assumptions which comply with the requirement in paragraph (2).
(2) The requirement is that further employer contributions would not be expected to be required to make provision for the scheme’s liabilities under a scheme (“S”), if the presumptions in paragraph (3) were satisfied in relation to S.
(3) The presumptions are—
(a)
the funding level(1) of S is 1:1, on a calculation of the liabilities of S which uses those actuarial assumptions, and
(b)
the assets of S are invested in accordance with a low dependency investment allocation.

Strength of the employer covenant
7.—(1) For the purposes of these Regulations, the strength of the employer covenant has the meaning given in paragraph (2) and is assessed in accordance with paragraphs (3) to (6).
(2) The strength of the employer covenant means—
(a)
the financial ability of the employer, in relation to its legal obligations to the scheme, to support the scheme, and
(b)
the expected level of support for the scheme from any contingent assets (whether from the employer in relation to the scheme, group undertakings or other persons), to the extent the trustees or managers of the scheme could reasonably expect the contingent assets to be—
(i)
legally enforceable by them, and
(ii)
sufficient to provide that support at such time as the trustees or managers may be required to enforce the support to the scheme.
(3) The strength of the employer covenant is assessed in relation to an assessment of the difference between the value of the assets of the scheme and the value of its liabilities.
(4) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), the matters to be considered in assessing the financial ability of the employer, in relation to its legal obligations to the scheme, to support the scheme are—
(a)
the cash flow, and expected future cash flow, of the employer,
(b)
other matters which are likely to affect the employer’s future ability to support the scheme including but not limited to the performance, future development and resilience of the employer’s business, and the likelihood of an insolvency event(1) occurring in relation to that employer,
(c)
for how long the trustees or managers of the scheme can be reasonably certain that they can rely on an assessment of the matters in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b), and
(d)
for how long the trustees or managers of the scheme can be reasonably certain that the employer will be able to continue to support the scheme.
(5) For the purposes of paragraph (3)—
(a)
the assessment of the difference between the value of the assets of the scheme and the value of its liabilities is to be assessed by reference to—
(i)
the actuary’s(2) estimate of the value of the liabilities calculated on a low dependency funding basis, and
(ii)
the actuary’s estimate of the solvency of the scheme, as defined by regulation 7(6) of the Occupational Pension Schemes (Scheme Funding) Regulations 2005 (actuarial valuations and reports)(3), and
(b)
in considering how much weight is to be given to each of the estimates referred to in sub-paragraph (a) for the purposes of the assessment, account is to be given to the likelihood of an event occurring which would result in an amount being treated as a debt due from the employer to the trustees or managers of the scheme under section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995 (deficiencies in the assets)(4).
(6) Where an assessment of the strength of the employer covenant is being carried out for the purposes of a determination, review or revision of a funding and investment strategy, or the subsequent preparation, review or revision of a statement of strategy setting out that funding and investment strategy, the actuary’s estimates referred to in paragraph (5) are the estimates set out in the actuarial valuation to which the funding and investment strategy relates.
(1)
“Insolvency event” is defined by section 121 of the Act.
(2)
By virtue of section 233 of the Act, “actuary” is defined by section 47 of the Pensions Act 1995 (c. 26).

Matters
1.  In determining or revising a scheme’s funding and investment strategy, the trustees or managers of the scheme must take into account—
(a)
the actuary’s estimate of the date on which the scheme is expected to (or, if applicable, did) reach significant maturity, as set out in the actuarial valuation to which the funding and investment strategy relates,
(b)
the actuary’s estimate of the maturity of the scheme as at the effective date of the actuarial valuation to which the funding and investment strategy relates, as set out in that actuarial valuation, and
(c)
the objective that on and after the relevant date the assets to which the minimum funding level relates, as provided for in paragraph 3, are invested in accordance with a low dependency investment allocation.
Principles
2.  The trustees or managers of a scheme must, in determining or revising the scheme’s funding and investment strategy, follow the principles set out in paragraphs 3 to 5 of this Schedule.
Minimum requirement on and after the relevant date
3.  On and after the relevant date a minimum requirement that a scheme is subject to is that the scheme has sufficient and appropriate assets such that the funding level of the scheme calculated in accordance with the requirements in regulation 9(2) and (3) is as a minimum 1:1 (“the minimum funding level”).
Risk in relation to calculation of liabilities on journey plan
4.—(1) The principles set out in sub-paragraph (2) relate to the level of risk that can be taken by the trustees or managers of a scheme in determining the actuarial assumptions used for the purposes of calculating the liabilities of the scheme as it moves along its journey plan.
(2) The principles are that the level of risk that can be taken—
(a)
is dependent on the strength of the employer covenant (so that more risk can be taken where the employer covenant is stronger and less risk can be taken where the employer covenant is weaker);
(b)
subject to paragraph (a), depends on how near the scheme is to reaching the relevant date (so that, subject to the strength of the employer covenant, more risk can be taken where a scheme is a long way from reaching the relevant date and less risk can be taken where a scheme is near to reaching the relevant date).
Liquidity
5.  The assets of the scheme must be invested in investments with sufficient liquidity to enable the scheme to meet expected cash flow requirements and make reasonable allowance for unexpected cash flow requirements.

Maturity
4.  The actuary’s estimate of the maturity of the scheme as at the effective date of the actuarial valuation to which the funding and investment strategy relates, as set out in that valuation.
5.  Where, in accordance with regulation 4(5), the trustees or managers of the scheme have taken into consideration whether new members may be admitted to the scheme and the future accrual of benefits—
(a)
a calculation of the duration of liabilities and future accrual based on the assumptions used, and
(b)
the number of years of future accrual that have been allowed for when estimating the date of significant maturity.
6.  For a scheme which has not reached the relevant date, how the maturity of the scheme is expected to change over time.
Investment risk
7.  The level of risk in relation to the intended investment of the assets of the scheme relating to the actuarial valuation to which the funding and investment strategy relates.
8.  For a scheme which has not reached the relevant date—
(a)
the level of risk the trustees or managers of the scheme intend to take in relation to the investment of the assets of the scheme as it moves along its journey plan, and
(b)
how the trustees or managers intend to achieve compliance with the matter in paragraph 1(c) of Schedule 1 by the relevant date.
9.  For a scheme which has reached the relevant date, how the level of risk, in relation to the intended investment of the assets of the scheme relating to the actuarial valuation to which the funding and investment strategy relates, complies with the matter in paragraph 1(c) of Schedule 1.
Liquidity
10.  How the investment of the assets of the scheme complies with the principle in paragraph 5 of Schedule 1.
Employer covenant

EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision relating to the funding of occupational pension schemes to which Part 3 of the Pensions Act 2004 (c. 35) (scheme funding) applies. They implement the amendments to that Part made by Schedule 10 to the Pension Schemes Act 2021 (c. 1) (funding of defined benefit schemes).
Part 1 of these Regulations contains preliminary matters. In particular, it sets out (in regulation 2) where some of the key concepts used in the Regulations are defined and (in regulation 3) makes provision for review of regulations 4 to 19, pursuant to the requirement in section 28(2)(a) of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (c. 26) (duty to review regulatory provisions in secondary legislation).
Part 2 of these Regulations makes provision relating to the new requirement, in section 221A of the Pensions Act 2004 (“the 2004 Act”) (funding and investment strategy), for schemes to have a funding and investment strategy.
Regulations 4 to 7 define the key concepts underlying how schemes must give effect to this requirement. In particular, regulation 4 sets out how the maturity of a scheme is to be measured and the meaning of “significant maturity” in relation to a scheme; regulation 5 sets out the meaning of “low dependency investment allocation” in relation to the assets of a scheme; regulation 6 sets out the meaning of “low dependency funding basis” in relation to the calculation of the liabilities of a scheme; and regulation 7 sets out the meaning of “strength of the employer covenant” and how it is assessed.
Regulation 8 sets out how the “relevant date” is to be determined.
Regulation 9 sets out the actuarial methods and assumptions to be used for the purposes of specifying the funding level the trustees and managers intend the scheme to have achieved as at the relevant date. In particular, the liabilities of the scheme for this purpose must be calculated on a low dependency funding basis.
Regulation 10 ensures that when, in determining or revising a scheme’s funding and investment strategy, the trustees or managers of a scheme are required to use actuarial assumptions in the calculation of the liabilities of a scheme on a low dependency funding basis and the duration of liabilities measure, the trustees or managers must choose either the same set of assumptions or, in relation to the economic assumptions in a calculation of the duration of liabilities measure, the same methodology as is used for calculating the other assumptions.
Regulation 11 introduces Schedule 1 which sets out matters the trustees or managers must take into account, and principles they must follow, in determining or revising the scheme’s funding and investment strategy. The matters in Schedule 1 relate to estimates in relation to scheme maturity by the actuary appointed by the trustees or managers, and investment risk on and after the relevant date. The principles in Schedule 1 make provision regarding the minimum requirements that a scheme is subject to on and after the relevant date; the level of risk that can be taken in relation to the calculation of the liabilities of the scheme as it moves towards that date; and the liquidity of the assets of the scheme.
Regulation 12 makes provision regarding the level of detail required in a funding and investment strategy.
Regulation 13 sets out the period within which a funding and investment strategy must be determined and subsequently reviewed and revised.
Part 3 of these Regulations makes provision regarding the statement of strategy. The statement of strategy is prepared by the trustees or managers of a scheme under section 221B of the 2004 Act (statement of strategy). It consists of two parts: Part 1 is a written statement of the funding and investment strategy, and Part 2 is a written statement of supplementary matters.
Regulation 14 introduces Schedule 2 which sets out supplementary matters to be included in Part 2 of the statement of strategy, in addition to those required by section 221B of the 2004 Act.
Regulation 15 sets out the period within which Part 2 of a statement of strategy must be reviewed and revised.
Regulation 16 sets out requirements to be met by the person who is the chair of the trustees who is required by section 221B(6) of the 2004 Act to sign the statement of strategy.
Regulation 17 makes provision regarding the level of detail required in Part 2 of a statement of strategy.
Regulation 18 makes provision regarding the form of the statement of strategy. Regulation 19 makes provision for when the trustees or managers shall send the statement of strategy to the Regulator.
Part 4 of these Regulations amends the Occupational Pension Schemes (Scheme Funding) Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/3377). The amendments made by regulation 20(2), (3) and (5) are to take account of the new requirements relating to funding and investment strategies. In particular, they make provision for additional matters to be included in an actuarial valuation. The amendments made by regulation 20(4) make provision for determining whether a recovery plan is appropriate having regard to the nature and circumstances of the scheme.
