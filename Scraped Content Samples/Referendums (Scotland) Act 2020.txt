This Part has effect for controlling donations to permitted participants that either are not registered parties or are minor parties.
(2)
The following provisions have effect for the purposes of this Part.
(3)
In accordance with sub-paragraph (1), “permitted participant” does not include a permitted participant that is a registered party other than a minor party.
(4)
“Relevant donation”, in relation to a permitted participant, means a donation to the permitted participant for the purpose of meeting referendum expenses incurred by or on behalf of the permitted participant.
(5)
“Donation” is to be construed in accordance with paragraphs 31 to 33.
(6)
In relation to donations received by a permitted participant other than a designated organisation, references to a permissible donor do not include a registered party.
(7)
Where any provision of this Part refers to a donation for the purpose of meeting a particular kind of expenses incurred by or on behalf of a permitted participant—
(a)
the reference includes a reference to a donation for the purpose of securing that any such expenses are not so incurred, and
(b)
a donation is to be taken to be a donation for either of those purposes if, having regard to all the circumstances, it must reasonably be assumed to be such a donation.
(8)
Sub-paragraphs (9) and (10) apply to any provision of this Part which provides, in relation to a permitted participant, that money spent (otherwise than by or on behalf of the permitted participant) in paying expenses incurred directly or indirectly by the permitted participant is to constitute a donation to the permitted participant.

any money or other property is transferred to a permitted participant pursuant to any transaction or arrangement involving the provision by or on behalf of the permitted participant of any property, services or facilities or other consideration of monetary value, and
(b)
the total value in monetary terms of the consideration so provided by or on behalf of the permitted participant is less than the value of the money or (as the case may be) the market value of the property transferred,
the transfer of the money or property is (subject to sub-paragraph (4)) to be taken to be a gift to the permitted participant for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1)(a).
(3)
In determining for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1)(d) whether any property, services or facilities provided for the use or benefit of a permitted participant is or are so provided otherwise than on commercial terms, regard must be had to the total value in monetary terms of the consideration provided by or on behalf of the permitted participant in respect of the provision of the property, services or facilities.

the value of the money or (as the case may be) the market value of the property, in question, and
(b)
the total value in monetary terms of the consideration provided by or on behalf of the permitted participant.
(3)
The value of any donation falling within paragraph 31(1)(b) is to be taken to be the value of the money or (as the case may be) the market value of the property, transferred as mentioned in paragraph 32(1) and accordingly any value in monetary terms of any benefit conferred on the person providing the sponsorship in question is to be disregarded.
(4)
The value of any donation falling within paragraph 31(1)(d) is to be taken to be the amount representing the difference between—
(a)
the total value in monetary terms of the consideration that would have had to be provided by or on behalf of the permitted participant in respect of the provision of the property, services or facilities if the property, services or facilities had been provided on commercial terms, and
(b)
the total value in monetary terms of the consideration (if any) actually so provided by or on behalf of the permitted participant.

(3)
But, for the purposes of this schedule, any relevant donation received by a permitted participant from a trustee of any property (in the trustee's capacity as such) is to be regarded as a relevant donation received by the permitted participant from a person who is not a permissible donor unless it is—

an exempt trust donation, or
(b)
a relevant donation transmitted by the trustee to the permitted participant on behalf of beneficiaries under the trust who are—
(i)

(5)
In relation to each such separate donation, the principal donor must ensure that, at the time when the principal donation is received by the permitted participant, the responsible person is given—
(a)
(except in the case of a donation which the principal donor is treated as making) all such details in respect of the person treated as making the donation as are required by virtue of paragraph 41(1)(c) to be given in respect of the donor of a donation to which that paragraph applies, and

if it appears that the donor is a permissible donor, all such details in respect of the donor as are required by virtue of paragraph 41(1)(c) to be included in a statement under paragraph 40 in respect of a relevant donation.
(3)
If a permitted participant receives a donation which the permitted participant is prohibited from accepting by virtue of paragraph 35(1), or which it is decided the permitted participant should refuse, then—

It is a defence for a permitted participant or responsible person charged with an offence under sub-paragraph (4) to show that—

(b)
as a result, the responsible person believed the donor to be a permissible donor.
