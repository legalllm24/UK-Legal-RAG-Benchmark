EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure (Security Requirements for Relevant Connectable Products) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/1007) (“the 2023 Regulations”).
Regulation 3 amends paragraph 3 (information on minimum security update periods) of Schedule 1 to the 2023 Regulations to make it clear that, where a manufacturer of relevant connectable products extends the minimum length of time for which security updates relating to such products will be provided, the new minimum length of time must be published as soon as is practicable.
Schedule 3 to the 2023 Regulations lists products that are excepted from being considered relevant connectable products for the purposes of section 4 (relevant connectable products) of the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act 2022 (“the 2022 Act”). Regulation 4 inserts three new exceptions. This creates equivalent exceptions in Great Britain to the exceptions that apply in relation to the supply in Northern Ireland of products to which the following legislation applies—
Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on the approval and market surveillance of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles;
Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2013 on the approval and market surveillance of two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles; or
Regulation (EU) No 167/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 February 2013 on the approval and market surveillance of agricultural and forestry vehicles.
The exceptions created by regulation 4 are in line with the policy position previously notified to the World Trade Organisation in accordance with the United Kingdom’s obligations under the Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement (notification G/TBT/N/GBR/62) and to the EU Commission under the Technical Standards and Regulations Directive (notification 2023/7004/XI).
A full impact assessment has not been prepared for this instrument. The impact assessment for the 2023 Regulations was undertaken as if the amendments made by regulations 3 and 4 were already implemented. Copies of the impact assessment for the 2023 Regulations are available upon request to the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, 100 Parliament Street, London, SW1A 2BQ. That impact assessment is also accessible at https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2023/1007/impacts.
