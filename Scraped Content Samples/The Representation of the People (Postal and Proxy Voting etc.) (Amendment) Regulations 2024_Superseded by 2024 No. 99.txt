EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations correct errors in Schedule 2 to the Representation of the People (Postal and Proxy Voting etc.) (Amendment) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/1147). These Regulations amend the transitional provisions in that Schedule to provide for additional modifications of the postal poll card and proxy postal poll card to be used for certain elections and referendums for which the notice of election or referendum is published on or after 31st January 2024 and for which the date of poll is on or before 1st May 2024. Additional modifications are also added for the equivalent petition notices to be used for certain recall petitions under the Recall of MPs Act 2015 (c. 25) within the same period. The modifications provide for the correct description of criminal offences under section 61(4) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (c. 2) (and equivalent legislation) to be included on those poll cards and notices.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.
