(5)
After section 22A insert—
“22B
Prohibition on personal conduct of case
(1)
In proceedings to which subsection (2) applies, the special measures which may be authorised by virtue of section 12 or 13 for the purpose of taking the evidence of a vulnerable witness include prohibiting the parties to the proceedings from conducting their own cases in person.
(2)
The proceedings to which this subsection applies are—
(a)
relevant proceedings, and
(b)
proceedings in which the court is considering whether to make an order under section 11(1) of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995.
(3)
The prohibition may be applied to one or more of the parties or all of them.
(4)
The prohibition does not prevent a party to whom it applies from conducting the party's own case in person until the beginning of the first hearing in the proceedings at, or for the purposes of, which a witness is to give evidence.
(5)
Where the special measure described by subsection (1) is to be used the court must—
(a)
inform the parties to whom the prohibition applies that it applies to them,
(b)
explain to those parties the effect of the prohibition, and
(c)
ascertain whether each party to whom the prohibition applies has a solicitor to conduct the party's case.
(6)
If, at any point in the proceedings, the court—
(a)
ascertains that a party to whom the prohibition applies does not have a solicitor to conduct the party's case, and
(b)
is not satisfied that the party intends to engage a solicitor to do so,
the court must appoint a solicitor to conduct the party's case.
(7)
The court may only appoint a solicitor entered on the register established in accordance with section 7 of the Children (Scotland) Act 2020.
(8)
An appointed solicitor—
(a)
is to ascertain and act upon the instructions of the party for whom the solicitor has been appointed to act, or
(b)
in the event that the party gives no instructions, or gives instructions that are inadequate or perverse, is to act in the party's best interests.
(9)
An appointed solicitor—
(a)
may not be dismissed by the party for whom the solicitor has been appointed to act,
(b)
may be relieved from the appointment by the court if the court is satisfied that the solicitor is no longer able to act upon the party's instructions or in the party's best interests.
(10)
In this section, references to a party to proceedings do not include—
(a)
the Principal Reporter,
(b)
a person appointed to act as a curator ad litem in the proceedings,
(c)
a safeguarder for a child in the proceedings appointed under the 2011 Act.
(11)
For the avoidance of doubt, the special measure described by this section is a measure for the purpose of taking the evidence of a vulnerable witness, notwithstanding that the measure affects the conduct of the proceedings more widely.
22C
Requirement to prohibit personal conduct of case
(1)
Subsection (2) applies in relevant proceedings where—
(a)
the court is considering what special measure or measures would be most appropriate for the purpose of taking a witness's evidence,
(b)
because of conduct perpetrated or alleged to have been perpetrated by a party to the proceedings, the witness is deemed to be a vulnerable witness by virtue of section 11A, and
(c)
that party intends to examine, or cross-examine, the witness.
(2)
The court is to consider that the most appropriate special measure for the purpose of taking the witness's evidence (or one of them) is prohibiting the party referred to in subsection (1) from conducting the party's own case in person in accordance with section 22B.
(3)
If the court is required—
(a)
by this section to consider the special measure described by section 22B to be the most appropriate for the purpose of taking the witness's evidence, and
(b)
by section 12(3) to consider another special measure to be the most appropriate for the purpose,
the court is to consider those measures together to be the most appropriate for the purpose.
22D
Presumption that personal conduct of case should be prohibited
(1)
Where a court is considering what special measure or measures would be most appropriate for the purpose of taking a witness's evidence—
(a)
the presumption set out in subsection (2) applies (subject to subsection (4)) in relevant proceedings, and
(b)
the presumption set out in subsection (5) applies (subject to subsection (6)) in any other proceedings in which the court is considering whether to make an order under section 11(1) of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995.
(2)
The presumption referred to in subsection (1)(a) is that prohibiting each party who intends to examine, or cross-examine, the witness from conducting the party's own case in person, in accordance with section 22B, is the most appropriate special measure for the purpose of taking the witness's evidence (or one of them if the court considers other special measures to be appropriate too).
(3)
In subsection (2), “party” does not include a person mentioned in section 22B(10).
(4)
The presumption set out in subsection (2) is rebutted, in relation to a party, if (and only if) the court is satisfied that—
(a)
applying the special measure described by section 22B to the party would, in the circumstances, give rise to a significant risk of prejudice to the fairness of the proceedings or otherwise to the interests of justice, and
(b)
that risk significantly outweighs any risk of prejudice to the interests of the witness if the special measure is not applied to the party.
(5)
The presumption referred to in subsection (1)(b) is that if—
(a)
the witness is deemed to be a vulnerable witness either—
(i)
by virtue of section 11B(3) because an order or remedy granted by a court prohibits certain conduct towards the witness by a party to the proceedings, or
(ii)
by virtue of section 11B(4) because a party to the proceedings committed, or is alleged to have committed, an offence against the witness, and
(b)
the party in question intends to examine, or cross-examine, the witness,
prohibiting that party from conducting the party's own case in person, in accordance with section 22B, is the most appropriate special measure for the purpose of taking the witness's evidence (or one of them if the court considers other special measures to be appropriate too).
(6)
The presumption set out in subsection (5) is rebutted if (and only if)—
(a)
the court is satisfied that—
(i)
the witness has expressed a wish to give evidence without the benefit of the special measure described by section 22B being applied to the party, and
(ii)
it is appropriate for the witness to do so, or
(b)
the court is satisfied that—
(i)
applying the special measure described by section 22B to the party would, in the circumstances, give rise to a significant risk of prejudice to the fairness of the proceedings or otherwise to the interests of justice, and
(ii)
that risk significantly outweighs any risk of prejudice to the interests of the witness if the special measure is not applied to the party.
(7)
If the court is required—
(a)
by this section to consider the special measure described by section 22B to be the most appropriate for the purpose of taking the witness's evidence, and
(b)
by section 12(3) to consider another special measure to be the most appropriate for the purpose,
the court is to consider those measures together to be the most appropriate for the purpose.”.
