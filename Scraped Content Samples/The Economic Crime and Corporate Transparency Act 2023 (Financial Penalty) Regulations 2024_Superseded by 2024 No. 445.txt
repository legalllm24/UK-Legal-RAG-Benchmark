Penalties
7.—(1) A financial penalty must not exceed the maximum fine that could be imposed by a court for the same offence under criminal proceedings in the jurisdiction in which the offence was committed and, in any event, must not exceed £10,000.
(2) The registrar may not impose a daily rate penalty unless the person’s conduct constitutes an offence in respect of which a daily default fine may be imposed in the jurisdiction in which the offence was committed.
(3) In relation to conduct for which the fine for the relevant offence in the jurisdiction in which the offence was committed does not include a daily default fine, the registrar may impose more than one fixed penalty in relation to that conduct where there is a continuing contravention.
(4) For the purposes of a daily rate penalty—
(a)
the first day from which the amount may start to accumulate is the day after the day the registrar determines to be the day on which the person first engaged in the conduct amounting to a relevant offence;
(b)
unless the registrar determines an earlier date, the daily rate ceases to accumulate at the beginning of the earliest of—
(i)
the day on which the requirement to comply to which the offence relates is satisfied,
(ii)
the day on which that requirement no longer applies.
(5) Interest accrues on the amount of a financial penalty which has not been paid within the period stated in the penalty notice at such rate as the registrar may direct or, if no such direction is given, the rate for the time being specified in section 17 of the Judgments Act 1838(1).
(1)
1838 c. 110. Section 17 was amended by S.I. 1993/564 and S.I. 1998/2940.

8.—(1) Subject to paragraph (3), a person who has received a penalty notice under regulations 5 or 6(3) may appeal to the County Court or, in Scotland, the Sheriff Court on the grounds mentioned in paragraph (2).
(2) The grounds referred to in paragraph (1) are that the decision to issue a financial penalty, the level or type of financial penalty or any condition stated in the penalty notice—
(a)
is unlawful;
(b)
is irrational or unreasonable; or
(c)
has been made on the basis of a procedural impropriety or otherwise contravenes the rules of natural justice.
(3) No appeal may be brought unless the permission of the court has been obtained.
(4) No application for such permission may be made after 28 days beginning on the day after the date the penalty notice is given unless the court is satisfied that there was good reason for the failure of the applicant to seek permission before the end of that period.
(5) An applicant who seeks permission to appeal must serve written notice of the application on the registrar within 7 days beginning with the date on which the application for permission was issued. Such written notice must include a statement setting out the grounds on which the appeal is made.

dismiss the appeal;
(b)
vary the amount of the financial penalty;

Recovering penalties
9.—(1) The registrar may recover any of the amount of the financial penalty and any interest that has not been paid if—

no appeal relating to the financial penalty has been brought under regulation 8 during the period within which such an appeal may be brought; or
(b)
an appeal has been determined or withdrawn.
(2) In England and Wales, and in Northern Ireland, the amount of the financial penalty is recoverable as if it were payable under an order of the High Court.
(3) In Scotland, the financial penalty may be enforced in the same manner as an extract registered decree arbitral bearing a warrant for execution issued by the Sheriff Court of any sheriffdom in Scotland.
(4) Where action is taken under this regulation for the recovery of a sum payable under a penalty notice, the financial penalty is—
(a)
in relation to England and Wales, to be treated for the purposes of section 98 of the Courts Act 2003(1) as if it were a judgment entered in the High Court, and
(b)
in relation to Northern Ireland, to be treated for the purposes of Article 116 of the Judgments Enforcement (Northern Ireland) Order 1981(2) as if it were a judgment in respect of which an application has been accepted under Article 22 or 23(1) of that Order.

EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision relating to companies on the register kept by the registrar of companies (“the registrar”) in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 (c. 46). The provisions relate to financial penalties, appeals and enforcement.
The Regulations also amend the Register of Overseas Entities (Penalties and Northern Ireland Dispositions) Regulations 2023 in relation to the circumstances in which a financial penalty may not be imposed.
Part 2 confers power on the registrar to impose a financial penalty on a person if satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the person has engaged in conduct amounting to a relevant offence, as defined in section 1132A of the Companies Act 2006.
Regulations 4 and 5 set out the process by which the registrar may issue warning and penalty notices, as well as the necessary content of such notices, and the time periods for issuing such notices.
Regulation 6 allows the registrar to vary or revoke a penalty notice, as they consider appropriate, subject to regulation 7.
Regulation 7 sets out the maximum financial penalty that may be imposed under these Regulations and the rules for imposing and calculating penalties under a penalty notice.
Regulation 8 describes the process by which a person who has received a penalty notice may appeal and the time limits for applying for such an appeal.
Regulation 9 allows the registrar to recover the financial penalty (with any accrued interest) after the expiry of the period stated in the penalty notice, if no appeal has been brought or if an appeal has been determined or withdrawn. It also describes how the financial penalty is treated for recovery purposes in England and Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.
Part 5 makes amendments to the Register of Overseas Entities (Penalties and Northern Ireland Dispositions) Regulations 2023. Regulation 11 substitutes a new regulation 3(2), which clarifies the circumstances in which a financial penalty may not be imposed and aligns with the amendments made to the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022 by the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023. Regulations 12 to 20 make minor amendments to clarify the process for issuing a financial penalty and the calculation of such a penalty.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.
