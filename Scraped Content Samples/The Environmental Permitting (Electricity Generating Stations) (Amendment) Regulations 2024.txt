(8) An “HCR economic feasibility certification” is a statement that the operator has reasonable grounds to be believe that it will be economically feasible for a relevant generator to—
(a)
be converted to the use of hydrogen as the primary source of fuel during the lifetime of the relevant generator, and
(b)
use primarily that fuel.
(9) For the purposes of this paragraph “named storage site” means a geological disposal site approved under Chapter 3 of Part 1 of the Energy Act 2008 and other legislation which transposed Directive 2009/31/EC on the geological storage of carbon dioxide in relation to England and Wales, which is identified in a decarbonisation report as the site to which EG CO2 is to be transported.

it is technically feasible to retrofit the generator with the plant and facilities necessary for the use by that generator of hydrogen as its primary fuel; and
(b)
there is sufficient space for the technology or techniques proposed by the operator for the provision of hydrogen to the relevant generator.
Interpretation: general
6.—(1) In this Schedule—
“EG CO2”, in relation to a generator, means the carbon dioxide produced by, or in connection with, the generation of electricity by the generator;
“qualifying complete CCS system” means a system of plant and facilities for—
(a)
capturing some or all of the carbon dioxide (or any substance consisting primarily of carbon dioxide) that is produced by, or in connection with, the generation of electricity by a generating station;
(b)
transporting the carbon dioxide (or substance captured); and
(c)
disposing of it by way of permanent storage;
“the relevant amount of EG CO2”, in relation to a generator, means—
(a)
90% of EG CO2 produced by the generator each year, or
(b)
where the use of best available techniques (within the meaning given in Article 3(10) of the Industrial Emissions Directive) would result in a greater rate of capture of EG CO2 produced by the generator each year, that amount of EG CO2;
“relevant generator” means—
(a)
an in-scope generator, or
(b)
an in-scope generator as refurbished (whether or not substantially refurbished);
“standard relevant generator” means a relevant generator that is a standard facility.
(2) For the purposes of this Schedule, a generator is “substantially refurbished” if the cost of refurbishing a combustion plant exceeds 50% of the investment cost for a comparable new combustion plant.
PART 2
Applications for the grant or variation of an environmental permit
Application of Part 2 of this Schedule
7.—(1) This Part of this Schedule does not apply to any existing application.
(2) In this paragraph “existing application” means an application made before the day on which the Environmental Permitting (Electricity Generating Stations) (Amendment) Regulations 2024 come into force—
(a)
for the grant of an environmental permit under regulation 13, or
(b)
for the variation of an environmental permit under regulation 20(1).
Applications for the grant or variation of an environmental permit
8.—(1) An application for the grant of an environmental permit under regulation 13(1) for an in-scope generator must include a decarbonisation readiness report.
(2) A variation application must include a decarbonisation readiness report where the application relates to—
(a)
the substantial refurbishment of an in-scope generator, or
(b)
the addition of an in-scope generator.
(3) A variation application (other than one mentioned in sub-paragraph (2)) may include a decarbonisation readiness report.
(4) In this paragraph “variation application” means an application for a variation of an environmental permit under regulation 20(1).
(5) Paragraph 8(1) does not apply in respect of—
(a)
an existing medium combustion plant within the meaning of paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 25A with a rated thermal input of less than or equal to 5 megawatts, or
(b)
a Tranche A generator within the meaning of paragraph 3(3) of Schedule 25B with a rated thermal input equal to or less than 5 megawatts.
Determination of applications
9.—(1) Where, as required or permitted by paragraph 8, a decarbonisation readiness report is submitted with an application for the grant or variation of an environmental permit, the regulator may only grant that application if it determines that the CCR conditions or, as the case may be, the HCR conditions are met.
(2) In the case of an application in respect of a standard relevant generator, the regulator may, without further enquiry, accept a statement made in the application or any accompanying decarbonisation readiness report that the CCR conditions or, as the case may be, the HCR conditions are met, as conclusive proof of the truth of the satisfaction of those conditions.
(3) The regulator’s determination under sub-paragraph (1) must have regard to the CCR technical assessment or the HCR technical assessment included in the relevant decarbonisation readiness report.
(4) An environmental permit granted pursuant to an application of the kind referred to in sub-paragraph (1)—
(a)
must include a condition requiring the holder of the permit to carry out a review of their decarbonisation readiness report at intervals not exceeding 2 years;
(b)
may include a condition requiring the permit holder to report to the regulator the findings of the review;
(c)
may include a condition that the CCR conditions or, as the case may be, the HCR conditions must be met.
(5) By way of an exception from paragraph (1), in the case of a relevant generator, the regulator may grant an application to vary an environmental permit, where that permit was granted on or before the day on which the Environmental Permitting (Electricity Generating Stations) (Amendment) Regulations 2024 come into force and the regulator is satisfied that, having regard to representations made, meeting the CCR conditions or, as the case may be, the HCR conditions would not be reasonably practicable due to the location or technical characteristics of the relevant generator.”.

EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016 (“the Permitting Regulations”). These amendments apply only in relation to certain generators in England.
Regulations 4 and 5 introduce a new Schedule 25C into the Permitting Regulations.
The Permitting Regulations are amended so as to introduce additional requirements in relation to certain regulated facilities which generate electricity (“in-scope generators”). “Regulated facility” is defined in regulation 8 of the Permitting Regulations.
Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the new Schedule 25C provide that where an application for an environmental permit is made on or after the day on which these Regulations come into force in respect of an in-scope generator, or for the variation of an environmental permit already granted in respect of an in-scope generator because it is to be substantially refurbished or another combustion plant is to be added to it, the operator must demonstrate that it satisfies certain technical conditions in relation to the feasibility of using carbon capture and storage or conversion to hydrogen firing electricity generation (“the baseline requirements”) and confirm that it is satisfied that other requirements relating to the feasibility of conversion to and operation of those technologies are met. The operator must provide a report as part of its application which includes the necessary information (a “decarbonisation readiness report”).
The Environment Agency will be able to grant the relevant environmental permit, or variation of the relevant environmental permit, only if the operator has submitted a decarbonisation readiness report and the Agency determines that the baseline requirements are met. Regulation 9(2) provides that the regulator may in the case of an application in respect of a standard generator rely on a statement that the CCR or HCR conditions are met without being obliged to make further enquiry.
These new provisions replace, in England, the requirements currently imposed by the Carbon Capture Readiness (Electricity Generating Stations) Regulations (S.I. 2013/2696) (“the 2013 Regulations”). Regulations 7 to 9 therefore make consequential amendments to the 2013 Regulations together with related transitional provisions and savings.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument because no, or no significant, impact is foreseen on the private, voluntary or public sector.
