EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends Schedule A2 to the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 (c. 52) (“the Act”).
Schedule A2 to the Act lists the tribunal jurisdictions to which section 207A of the Act (Effect of failure to comply with Code: adjustment of awards) applies. Where section 207A of the Act applies, and where it appears to the employment tribunal that a relevant Code of Practice applies and that the employer has unreasonably failed to comply with it, the employment tribunal may increase any award it makes to the employee by no more than 25%. The employee’s award may be reduced by no more than 25% where it is the employee who has unreasonably failed to comply with the relevant Code of Practice. A relevant Code of Practice is one which relates exclusively or primarily to procedure for the resolution of disputes.
Article 2 of this Order adds section 189 of the Act (failure to follow consultation requirements) to the list of tribunal jurisdictions to which section 207A of the Act applies.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.
