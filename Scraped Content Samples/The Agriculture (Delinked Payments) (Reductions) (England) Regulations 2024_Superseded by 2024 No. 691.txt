EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision in connection with the introduction of delinked payments by the Agriculture (Delinked Payments and Consequential Provisions) (England) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/1430) (“the Delinked Payments Regulations”). They extend to England and Wales but apply in relation to England only.
Regulation 3 introduces a requirement on the Secretary of State to make reductions to the amount of a delinked payment calculated by the Secretary of State in respect of a person under paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 to the Delinked Payments Regulations for the year beginning on 1st January 2024. The Secretary of State must reduce the portion of a delinked payment for a person specified in column 1 of the table under regulation 3(2) by the reduction percentage or percentages that are specified in the corresponding entry in column 2 of that table.
Regulation 4 modifies references to a “delinked payment” in Part 3 of the Delinked Payments Regulations so that they are to be construed as references to the amount of a delinked payment after the application of the reduction percentage or percentages applied by the Secretary of State to that payment by virtue of regulation 3.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.
