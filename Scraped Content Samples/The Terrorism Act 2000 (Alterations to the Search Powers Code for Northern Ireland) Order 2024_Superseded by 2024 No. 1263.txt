EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
The Secretary of State has made alterations to the search powers code for Northern Ireland. The alterations (a) reflect the creation of the new power in section 43C of the Terrorism Act 2000 (c. 11) under which a constable may stop and search terrorist offenders released on licence, and (b) make other minor changes. The new stop and search power applies when a terrorist offender’s licence includes a search condition and the constable is satisfied that the search is necessary for purposes connected with protecting members of the public from a risk of terrorism.
This Order brings the alterations into force following their approval by each House of Parliament.
A copy of the revised code of practice referred to in this instrument is available publicly online as www.gov.uk and hard copies can be obtained by writing to the Northern Ireland Office, Erskine House, 20-32 Chichester St, Belfast BT1 4GF.
A full impact statement has not been produced for this Order as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.
