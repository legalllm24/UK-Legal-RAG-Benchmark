EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order provides for the regulation of anaesthesia associates and physician associates (“associates”) by the General Medical Council (“the Regulator”).
Article 3 requires the Regulator to set standards in relation to education, training and registration of associates. It enables the Regulator to set other standards. It also provides for consultation and review in that respect. Article 4 enables the Regulator to give approvals in relation to education and training of associates; to attach conditions to such approvals and to withdraw them.
Articles 5 and 6 provide for the Regulator’s Registrar to register associates and to maintain the register. Article 7 requires the Regulator to periodically assess whether a registrant continues to meet the standards set under article 3. Article 8 allows for conditions to be imposed on associates’ registration; and article 9 provides for the removal of entries in the register.
