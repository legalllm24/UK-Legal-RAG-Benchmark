“specified period” means a period beginning on 1st January and ending on the following 31st December and any such period is referred to in this Order as an “obligation period”.
(4) A supplier’s main obligation for an obligation period within column 1 of the table in paragraph (7) is the amount of sustainable aviation fuel that has a total energy content equal to the percentage of the supplier’s obligated amount for that period set out in the corresponding entry in column 2 of the table.
(5) A supplier’s power-to-liquid aviation fuel obligation for an obligation period within column 1 of the table in paragraph (7) is the amount of power-to-liquid aviation fuel that has a total energy content equal to the percentage of the supplier’s obligated amount for that period set out in the corresponding entry in column 3 of the table.
(6) The obligated amount for an obligation period is determined as follows—
(a)
calculate the notional amount of relevant aviation turbine fuel which the supplier has supplied during the obligation period (see paragraph (8)); and

Determination of amounts of sustainable aviation fuel
4.—(1) Subject to article 23(4), where it is shown that a person owns an amount of aviation fuel at the assessment time, it is presumed that that amount of fuel is supplied by that person at, or for delivery to, places in the United Kingdom at that time.
(2) The presumption in paragraph (1) is to be displaced only if the Administrator is satisfied that the fuel will not be supplied at, or for delivery to, places in the United Kingdom.
(3) In relation to sustainable aviation fuel at its assessment time, an amount of relevant sustainable aviation fuel only counts towards the discharging of a person’s SAF obligation for an obligation period if it meets the sustainability criteria.
(4) For the purpose of discharging a person’s SAF obligation or of issuing SAF certificates, the amount of sustainable aviation fuel, expressed in megajoules, is the notional amount determined in accordance with the following formula—
where—
RN is the notional amount of relevant sustainable aviation fuel;
i is the first consignment of relevant sustainable aviation fuel supplied during the obligation period for which the supplier has submitted an application for certificates to the Administrator in accordance with article 16;
j is the final consignment of relevant sustainable aviation fuel supplied during the obligation period for which the supplier has submitted an application for certificates to the Administrator in accordance with article 16;
MA is the total mass (in kilograms) of relevant sustainable aviation fuel supplied by that person during the obligation period;
LHV is the lower heating value of the relevant sustainable aviation fuel;
RF is the percentage of MA which is attributable to a relevant feedstock;
S is the mass (in kilograms) of MA which meets the sustainability criteria;
T is the mass (in kilograms) of MA which is attributable to a relevant feedstock;
CF is the average lifecycle carbon intensity of fossil jet fuel equal to 89gCO2e/MJ;
CS is the lifecycle carbon intensity (in gCO2e/MJ) of relevant sustainable aviation fuel supplied during the obligation period;
CR is the average reference lifecycle carbon intensity of sustainable aviation fuel of 26.7 gCO2e/MJ.
(5) For the purposes of paragraph (4)—
(a)
to the extent that relevant sustainable aviation fuel consists of energy-derived aviation fuel—
(i)
where the process energy used to produce the energy-derived aviation fuel is electricity that is entirely taken from the national electricity grid of the country in which the energy-derived aviation fuel is or was produced, RF is taken to be the annual average percentage of electricity for that country’s national grid which is produced from nuclear sources and renewable sources other than biomass; or
(ii)
if the Administrator considers that it is not appropriate to use the methodology in sub-paragraph (i) to determine the value for RF, RF is to be determined in accordance with such other methodology as the Administrator may consider appropriate in a particular case,
for that portion of relevant sustainable aviation fuel;
(b)
where hydrogen is used for hydroprocessing during the production of aviation fuel, RF is to be determined by excluding that hydrogen; and
(c)
where hydrogen is physically incorporated into synthetic aviation fuel during its production, RF is to be determined by including that hydrogen.
(6) Where fossil fuel is blended with other fuel, the fossil fuel proportion of the blended fuel is to be disregarded for the purposes of—
(a)
calculating the notional amount of relevant sustainable aviation fuel under paragraph (4); and
(b)
determining whether an amount of sustainable aviation fuel meets the sustainability criteria.
(7) In this article—
“fossil fuel” means coal, substances produced directly or indirectly from coal, lignite, natural gas, crude liquid petroleum, or petroleum products;
“hydroprocessing” means refining aviation fuel using hydrogen—
(a)
to remove atoms, such as but not limited to sulphur, oxygen and nitrogen, from an existing hydrocarbon molecule; or
(b)
to shorten an existing hydrocarbon molecule (hydrocracking processes);
“synthetic aviation fuel” means an aviation fuel in which hydrocarbons are created from a mixture of hydrogen and other molecules.

allows amounts of relevant feedstock or fuel with different sustainability characteristics to be mixed (“the mixture”);
(b)
provides for the sustainability characteristics of amounts added to the mixture to be attributed to other amounts withdrawn from the mixture; and
(c)
requires the sustainability characteristics attributed to the sum of the amounts withdrawn from the mixture to be the same, and in the same quantities, as the sustainability characteristics attributed to the sum of the amounts added to the mixture.
(6) For the purposes of paragraphs (2) to (5), the sustainability characteristics of relevant feedstock or fuel include—
(a)
its type;
(b)
its place of origin; and

(3) Where—
(a)
a transfer relates to some (but not all) of the SAF certificates held by a transferor on the date of the transfer, and
(b)
the SAF certificates held by the transferor on that date were not all issued at the same date and time,
it is to be presumed, unless the transferor notifies the Administrator otherwise at the same time as notifying the Administrator of the details of the transfer in accordance with paragraph (2)(a), that the transfer relates to the certificates which were issued at the earlier dates and times.
(4) In the event of there being an insufficient number of certificates held to the credit of a transferor’s account on the notified date to transfer certificates to two or more transferees, the Administrator must give priority to the transfer which was first notified to the Administrator.
(5) For the purposes of this Order, the Administrator transfers a SAF certificate from one account holder (“the transferor”) to another account holder (“the transferee”) by recording a debit of a SAF certificate in the transferor’s SAF account and a credit of a SAF certificate in the SAF account of the transferee.

Payments
21.—(1) As soon as reasonably practicable after the end of an obligation period, the Administrator must notify each obligated supplier of the following—
(a)
the specified amount of relevant sustainable aviation fuel which the Administrator calculates should, in accordance with section 124(2)(b) of the 2004 Act and article 3(3), have been supplied at or for delivery to places in the United Kingdom during that obligation period, and
(b)
the number of each type of SAF certificate being held to the credit of the supplier’s SAF account, and the number of each type of SAF certificate which may be used as evidence for the purposes of meeting the supplier’s SAF obligation for that obligation period.
(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the maximum number of SAF certificates for relevant sustainable aviation fuel derived from segregated oils and fats that may be used to meet (or towards meeting) the supplier’s SAF obligation may not exceed the number of such certificates which corresponds with the amount calculated under article 22.
(3) A certificate may be produced as evidence by the supplier under this Order—
(a)
by means of an electronic submission transmitted to a website of the Administrator, which identifies the credit of a certificate in the supplier’s SAF account, or
(b)
by other means, in a case where the Administrator determines that it is appropriate to allow production of a SAF certificate by those means.
(4) A supplier must notify the Administrator of the number and type of SAF certificates held in the supplier’s SAF account which are to be counted towards the discharge of the supplier’s SAF obligation for an obligation period, and which are to be debited by the Administrator from the SAF account.
(5) That notification must be given to the Administrator by the specified date referred to in article 3(3).
(6) Any SAF certificate for power-to-liquid aviation fuel supplied by a supplier during an obligation period, which is not required to meet the supplier’s power-to-liquid aviation fuel obligation for that period, may count towards the discharge of the supplier’s main obligation for that period.
(7) Where a supplier fails to notify the Administrator of the number of SAF certificates to be counted towards the discharge of its SAF obligation by the date mentioned in paragraph (5), the Administrator must take the number to be nil.
(8) A supplier that does not wholly discharge its SAF obligation for an obligation period by the production of evidence in accordance with paragraph (3) by the specified date referred to in article 3(3) must pay to the Administrator a sum (the “buy-out amount”) determined in accordance with paragraph (9).
(9) The “buy-out amount” is determined as follows.
Step 1
Calculate in megajoules—
(a)
the PtL amount; and
(b)
the SAF amount.
Step 2
Calculate in megajoules—
(a)
the PtL obligation shortfall; and
(b)
the main obligation shortfall.
Step 3
Multiply the PtL obligation shortfall by £0.145 (“sum A”).
Step 4
Multiply the main obligation shortfall by £0.137 (“sum B”).
Step 5
Add sum A and sum B to obtain the buy-out amount.
(10) In paragraph (9)—
“PtL amount” means the amount of power-to-liquid aviation fuel for which the supplier has produced SAF certificates as evidence towards meeting the supplier’s power-to-liquid aviation fuel obligation during the obligation period;
“PtL obligation shortfall” means the amount by which the PtL amount falls short of the amount needed to meet the supplier’s power-to-liquid aviation fuel obligation;
“SAF amount” means the amount of sustainable aviation fuel of any type for which the supplier has produced SAF certificates as evidence towards meeting the supplier’s main obligation during the obligation period; and
“main obligation shortfall” means the amount by which the SAF amount falls short of the amount needed to meet the supplier’s main obligation.
(11) For the purposes of section 128(1) of the 2004 Act and this Order, the period within which the buy-out amount, calculated under paragraph (9), must be paid to the Administrator (the “buy-out payment period”) is the period beginning on 1st January of the year immediately following the obligation period for which the buy-out amount is calculated and ending on the 26th October of that year.
(12) Where a supplier fails to pay the full buy-out amount to the Administrator before the end of the buy-out payment period—
(a)
any unpaid part of the buy-out amount is to increase at the rate specified in paragraph (13), and the increase is to be calculated in accordance with paragraph (14); and
(b)
the increased buy-out amount is a debt due from the supplier to the Administrator until it has been paid in full.
(13) The rate referred to in paragraph (12)(a) is 5 percentage points above the base rate of the Bank of England on the day immediately after the last day of the buy-out payment period in question.
(14) The increase is calculated on a daily basis beginning on the day immediately after the last day of the buy-out payment period in question, and ending on the date on which payment is received by the Administrator.

Use of SAF certificates in later obligations periods
23.—(1) Any SAF certificate may count towards the discharge of no more than 25% of a supplier’s main obligation in the next obligation period.
(2) A SAF certificate for power-to-liquid aviation fuel may count towards the discharge of no more than 25% of a supplier’s power-to-liquid aviation fuel obligation in the next obligation period.
(3) A SAF certificate for sustainable aviation fuel derived from segregated oils and fats may count towards the discharge of no more than 25% of the maximum amount of sustainable aviation fuel derived from segregated oils and fats that may count towards the discharge of the supplier’s main obligation, determined in accordance with article 22, in the next obligation period.
(4) If, as a result of this article, a SAF certificate may count towards the discharge of any part of a supplier’s SAF obligation in the next obligation period, the production of the certificate by the supplier to the Administrator counts as evidence that the amount of sustainable aviation fuel stated in the certificate was supplied by the supplier at, or for delivery to, places in the United Kingdom during that period.
(5) In this article “next obligation period”, in relation to a SAF certificate, means the obligation period immediately following the obligation period for which the SAF certificate was issued.

(2) A supplier is liable for a civil penalty if that supplier contravenes article 6(2) or 21(8).
(3) A supplier or other person is liable for a civil penalty if at the time that supplier or other person provides the information or produces the evidence referred to in article 6(7), 7(3), 11(6), 12(5), 16(5) or 20(14)—
(a)
that supplier or other person has not taken reasonable steps to ensure that the information or evidence is accurate to the best of their knowledge or belief, or
(b)
that supplier or other person has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the information or evidence is accurate to the best of their knowledge or belief, but the condition set out in paragraph (4) or (5) is subsequently satisfied.
(4) In the case of article 6(7) or 7(3), the condition is that the supplier or other person has subsequently—
(a)
become aware that the information or evidence may be inaccurate but has not informed the Administrator of that fact within twenty working days of so becoming aware,
(b)
been informed by the Administrator that the information or evidence may be inaccurate but has not investigated and, if the information or evidence is inaccurate, remedied the inaccuracy within such period as may reasonably be allowed by the Administrator, or

in the case of an account holder who has gained, or attempted to gain, one or more SAF certificates by contravening a provision referred to in paragraph (1), an amount equivalent to twice the value of the SAF certificates which the account holder has gained, or attempted to gain, and
(b)
in any other case, £100,000.
(9) For the purposes of paragraph (8)(a), the value of a SAF certificate is an amount equal to the amount under article 21(8) for the amount of fuel to which the certificate relates (if that fuel were to fall within the PtL shortfall or the main obligation shortfall).
(10) For the purposes of section 129(3)(b) of the 2004 Act, the turnover of the specified business of the defaulter is the applicable turnover for the business year preceding the date of the civil penalty notice.
(11) Where the business year preceding the date of the civil penalty notice does not equal 12 months, the turnover is the amount which bears the same proportion to the applicable turnover during that business year as 12 months does to the period of that business year.
(12) Where there is no preceding business year, the turnover is the applicable turnover of the defaulter for the period of 12 months ending on the last day of the month preceding the month in which the date of the civil penalty notice falls.
(13) Where in the application of paragraph (12) the defaulter has applicable turnover for a period of less than 12 months, the turnover is the amount which bears the same proportion to the applicable turnover during the period for which the defaulter has applicable turnover as 12 months does to that period.
(14) Where a defaulter does not pay the penalty, or any part of it, to the Administrator on or before the date on which the civil penalty must be paid—
(a)
the sum outstanding is to increase at the rate specified in paragraph (15) and the increase is to be calculated in accordance with paragraph (16); and
(b)
the increased sum is a debt due from the defaulter to the Administrator until it has been paid in full.
(15) The rate for the purposes of paragraph (14)(a) is 5 percentage points above the base rate of the Bank of England on the day after the date on which the civil penalty must be paid to the Administrator.
(16) The increase is to be calculated on a daily basis beginning on the day after the date on which the civil penalty must be paid to the Administrator, and ending on the date on which payment is received by the Administrator.
(17) In this article—
“applicable turnover” means the amounts, ascertained in conformity with normal accounting practice in the United Kingdom, which are—
(a)
derived by the defaulter from the supply of relevant aviation turbine fuel, and
(b)
computed on an accruals basis so that those amounts relating to the period for which the turnover is being determined are taken into account, without regard to the date of invoice or receipt of payment,
after deduction of trade discounts, value added tax and any other taxes based on such amounts;
“business year” means a period of more than six months for which a defaulter publishes accounts or, if no such accounts have been published for the period, prepares accounts; and
“date of the civil penalty notice” means the date on which the Administrator gives notice under section 129(2) of the 2004 Act.

Article 2
Schedule 1
Sustainability criteria
1.  In this Schedule—
“GHG emissions saving threshold” means the threshold established in accordance with paragraph 5; and
“minimum GHG emissions saving” means the percentage amount determined in accordance with paragraph 7.
2.  To the extent that relevant sustainable aviation fuel was produced from a feedstock listed in column (2) of the table below, that feedstock meets the sustainability criteria if it meets the conditions specified for the feedstock concerned in column (3) of the table.
(1) Entry number (2) Feedstock (3) Conditions that the feedstock must meet in order to comply with sustainability criteria
1 Forest biomass, including residues from forestry or wastes from forestry The GHG emissions saving threshold and the forest criteria
2 Residues, including processing residues, which are not residues from agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries or forestry The GHG emissions saving threshold
3 Wastes of biological origin, which are not wastes from agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries or forestry The GHG emissions saving threshold
4 Residues from agriculture or wastes from agriculture The GHG emissions saving threshold, the land criteria and the soil carbon criteria
5 Renewable energy of non-biomass origin or nuclear energy The GHG emissions saving threshold
6 Wastes of fossil origin The GHG emissions saving threshold, the land criteria and the sustainable waste criteria
7 Any feedstock not falling within entries 1 to 6 above The GHG emissions saving threshold and the land criteria
3.  A feedstock meets the soil carbon criteria if the supplier provides evidence, by reference to the guidance published by the Administrator under article 14(1)(f), that satisfies the Administrator that adequate monitoring or management plans are in place for the land concerned which address the impacts on soil quality and soil carbon of the harvesting of the relevant feedstock from that land.
4.  A waste of fossil origin meets the sustainable waste management criteria if the supplier provides evidence, by reference to the guidance published by the Administrator under article 14(1)(f), that satisfies the Administrator that adequate monitoring or management plans are in place to address the local environmental impacts caused by sourcing or processing the waste.
5.  Subject to paragraph 6, an amount of sustainable aviation fuel meets the GHG emissions saving threshold if the GHG emissions saving from its use is equal to or greater than the minimum GHG emissions saving applicable to that fuel.
6.  Where the sustainable aviation fuel is produced partly from raw materials other than sustainable feedstocks, the minimum GHG emissions saving for the purposes of this Schedule applies only to the mass (in kilograms) of that fuel which is attributable to sustainable feedstocks.
7.  The minimum GHG emissions saving from the use of an amount of relevant sustainable aviation fuel is the greater of—
(a)
where applicable, the default value determined by reference to the guidance published by the Administrator under article 14(1)(f); or
(b)
the actual value determined by reference to the guidance published by the Administrator under article 14(1)(f).

Article 2
Schedule 2
Land criteria
1.  A relevant feedstock meets the land criteria if the supplier provides evidence, by reference to the guidance published by the Administrator under article 14(1)(f), that satisfies the Administrator that the relevant feedstock was not obtained from land of a description falling within paragraphs 2 to 5, subject to the exceptions set out in those paragraphs.
2.  Land with a high biodiversity value that had one of the following statuses in or after January 2008, whether or not the land continues to have that status—
(a)
primary forest or other wooded land of native species, where there is no clearly visible indication of human activity and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed;
(b)
land not falling within sub-paragraph (a) which is, or which has been identified as, highly biodiverse forest or other wooded land that is species-rich and not degraded, unless—
(i)
the land is designated for nature protection purposes; and
(ii)
evidence is provided that satisfies the Administrator that the production of the relevant feedstock did not interfere with the nature protection purposes for which the land is designated;
(c)
land not falling within sub-paragraphs (a) or (b) which is designated for nature protection purposes, including for the protection of rare, threatened or endangered ecosystems or species, unless evidence is provided that satisfies the Administrator that the production of the relevant feedstock did not interfere with the nature protection purposes for which the land is designated;
(d)
highly biodiverse grassland spanning more than one hectare that is—
(i)
natural grassland that would remain as grassland and that maintains its natural species composition and ecological characteristics and processes in the absence of human intervention; or
(ii)
non-natural grassland that would cease to be grassland in the absence of human intervention and that is species-rich and not degraded and which has been identified as being highly biodiverse, unless evidence is provided that satisfies the Administrator that the harvesting of the raw material is necessary to preserve its status as highly biodiverse grassland.
3.  Subject to paragraph 4, land with high-carbon stock that had one of the following statuses at any time in January 2008 and which no longer has that status—
(a)
wetlands, where the land is covered with, or saturated by, water permanently or for a significant part of the year;
(b)
continuously forested areas spanning more than one hectare with trees higher than five metres and a canopy cover of more than 30%, or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ;
(c)
land spanning more than one hectare with trees higher than five metres and a canopy cover of between 10% and 30%, or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ, unless evidence is provided that satisfies the Administrator that the GHG emissions saving from the use of the sustainable aviation fuel concerned is equal to or greater than the minimum GHG emissions saving applicable to the fuel at the time when it is used, as set out in Schedule 1.
4.  Paragraph 3 does not apply if, at the time the relevant feedstock was harvested, the land concerned had the same status as it had in January 2008.
5.  Land that was peatland at any time in January 2008, unless evidence is provided that satisfies the Administrator that the cultivation and harvesting of the raw material concerned did not involve drainage of previously undrained soil.

Article 2
Schedule 3
Forest criteria
1.  In this Schedule—
“forest regeneration” means the re-establishment of a forest stand by natural or artificial means following the removal of the previous stand by felling or as a result of natural causes, including fire or storm;
“sourcing area” means a geographically defined area—
(a)
from which the forest biomass is sourced;
(b)
for which reliable and independent information is available to show that the requirements in paragraph 3(a) to (e) were met, and
(c)
where conditions are sufficiently homogeneous to evaluate the risk of the sustainability, and legality characteristics, of the forest biomass.
2.  Forest biomass meets the forest criteria if the supplier provides evidence, by reference to the guidance published by the Administrator under article 14(1)(f), that satisfies the Administrator that the requirements in paragraphs 3 to 6 are met, subject to the exceptions set out in those paragraphs.
3.  Subject to paragraph 4, the country in which the forest biomass was harvested has in place a legal framework, including monitoring and enforcement systems, to ensure that—
(a)
the forest biomass has been harvested in accordance with applicable laws;
(b)
the area of harvesting of the forest biomass is subject to forest regeneration;
(c)
the forest biomass has not been harvested from wetlands, peatlands or from a protected area, unless—
(i)
the land is designated for nature protection purposes; and
(ii)
the production of the relevant feedstock did not interfere with the purposes for which the land is designated for nature protection purposes;
(d)
the harvesting of the forest biomass has been carried out with consideration for the maintenance of, and with the aim of minimising any decline in, soil quality and biodiversity; and
(e)
the harvesting of the forest biomass has been carried out in a manner that maintains or improves the long-term production capacity of the forest from which it was harvested.
4.  Where evidence is not available to demonstrate that the legal framework described in paragraph 3 is in place in the country concerned, the Administrator must be satisfied that management systems at the forest sourcing area level were in place in that country to ensure that the conditions in paragraph 3(a) to (e) were met.
5.  Subject to paragraph 6, the country or regional economic integration organisation of origin of the forest biomass is a party to the 2015 Paris Agreement(1) and—
(a)
has submitted a nationally determined contribution (“NDC”) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, covering emissions and removals from agriculture, forestry and land use which ensures that changes in carbon stock associated with forest biomass harvest are counted towards the country’s commitment to reduce or limit greenhouse gas emissions as specified in the NDC; or
(b)
has laws in place, which are applicable in the area of the harvesting, and which regulate the harvesting of forest biomass, to conserve and enhance carbon stocks and sinks, and which require that evidence is provided to show that reported land-use, land-use change and forestry-sector emissions do not exceed removals.
6.  Where evidence is not available to demonstrate that the requirement in paragraph 5 is satisfied, the Administrator must be satisfied that management systems were in place at the forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sink levels in the forest are maintained or increased over the long-term.

EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order implements Chapter 5 of Part 2 of the Energy Act 2004, and imposes an obligation on aviation fuel suppliers that supply aviation turbine fuel in the United Kingdom to produce evidence that a specified amount of sustainable aviation fuel has been supplied in the United Kingdom (the “SAF obligation”) (Part 2).
Part 3 makes the Secretary of State the Administrator under the Order (article 5) and makes provision for the administration and management of accounts for suppliers to ensure a record is kept of obligations and certificates (articles 6, 8 and 9). This Part also places specific duties on the Administrator in respect of the processing and collection of information, provision of guidance and determining feedstock eligibility (articles 10, 11, 14 and 15), and provides the Administrator with powers to enable it to fulfil those duties (articles 7, 12 and 14).
Part 4 sets out the application requirements for SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) certificates (article 16) along with the requirements for verifiers’ reports and declarations (article 17). This Part also provides for the issue of SAF certificates to suppliers who are subject to a SAF obligation, and to other suppliers who are not obligated (article 16). These certificates can then be produced as evidence that the obligation has been discharged. Certificates may also be transferred (article 19) or revoked (article 20).
Part 5 provides for the discharge of a SAF obligation by payment in cases where a supplier has not wholly discharged the obligation by producing sufficient SAF certificates (article 21); sets a limit on the maximum amount of SAF derived from segregated oils and fats that may be counted towards meeting a supplier’s main obligation (article 22); and sets limits on the proportion of SAF certificates issued for one obligation period that may be used to discharge a supplier’s obligation in a later obligation period (article 23).
Part 6 provides for a person that contravenes certain provisions to be liable to a civil penalty (article 24). It also provides for the process of objecting to a civil penalty (article 25). Section 131 of the Energy Act 2004 provides for appeals to be made to the High Court (in England and Wales or Northern Ireland) or the Court of Session (in Scotland) where a person disputes a liability to a penalty or claims that the penalty is too high.
Part 7 makes consequential amendments to the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations Order 2007 to remove fuel supplied for use in aircraft from that Order. This Part also amends the definition of support schemes in that Order so that the definition includes all support schemes not just those which apply within the European Economic Area and excludes investment aid, tax exemptions and reductions, and tax refunds.
Part 8 places a duty on the Secretary of State to review the regulatory provision contained in this Order every five years and publish a report setting out the conclusions of that review.
An impact assessment, in the form of a cost benefit analysis, on the effect that this Order will have on the costs of business and the voluntary sector is available from the Low Carbon Fuels Division, Department for Transport, Great Minster House, 33 Horseferry Road, London, SW1P 4DR. The impact assessment is annexed to the Explanatory Memorandum which is available alongside this Order on the UK legislation website at http://www.legislation.gov.uk.
