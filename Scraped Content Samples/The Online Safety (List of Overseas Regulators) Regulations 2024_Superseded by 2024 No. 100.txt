EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations specify those overseas regulators with whom the Office of Communications (“OFCOM”) can co-operate under their power in section 114 of the Online Safety Act 2023 (c. 50) (“the Act”). “Overseas regulator” is defined in section 114(7) as “a person exercising functions in a country outside the United Kingdom which correspond to any of OFCOM’s online safety functions” (defined in section 235).
Under the power in section 114(1) of the Act, OFCOM may only co-operate with an overseas regulator for the purposes of (a) facilitating the exercise by the overseas regulator of any of that regulator’s online regulatory functions, or (b) criminal investigations or proceedings relating to a matter to which the overseas regulator’s online regulatory functions relate. The term “online regulatory functions” is defined in section 114(7).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.
