This section makes provision about how—
(a)
the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA 2018”), and
(b)
the amendments made to that Act by the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act 2023 (“REULA 2023”),
are to apply for the purpose of interpreting enactments relating to value added tax or any duty of excise (“VAT and excise law”).

Section 4 of EUWA 2018 (retained EU rights, powers, liabilities etc) continues to have effect (despite the provision made by section 2 of REULA 2023) for the purpose of interpreting VAT and excise law subject to the following exception.
(3)
The exception is that Articles 110 and 111 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (which relate to internal taxation on products) have no effect for that purpose.

Section 5(A1) to (A3) of EUWA 2018 (which are inserted by section 3 of REULA 2023 and which abolish the supremacy of EU law) have effect in relation to VAT and excise law as they have effect in relation to other domestic enactments but only so far as they relate to the disapplication or quashing of any enactment as a result of EU law (and, accordingly, the superseded provisions continue to have effect for the purpose of interpreting VAT and excise law).
(5)
Retained general principles of EU law—
(a)
continue to be relevant (despite the provision made by section 4 of REULA 2023) for the purpose of interpreting VAT and excise law in the same way, and to the same extent, as they were relevant for that purpose before the coming into force of that section, but

(6)
In this section—
(a)
the reference to any duty of excise is to be read in accordance with section 49 of TCTA 2018,
(b)
the reference to the superseded provisions is a reference to section 5(1) to (3) of EUWA 2018 as those subsections had effect immediately before the passing of REULA 2023, and
(c)
the reference to retained general principles of EU law is to be read in accordance with EUWA 2018 as that Act had effect immediately before the passing of REULA 2023.
(7)
This section needs to be read with sections 42 and 47 of TCTA 2018 (which make other provision about EU law relating to VAT and excise law and which continue to have effect for the purpose mentioned in subsection (1) above).
(8)
This section is treated as having come into force on 1 January 2024.

1042H
Expenditure credit to count as taxable receipt
If a company is entitled to, and claims, an R&D expenditure credit for an accounting period, it must bring the amount of the credit into account as a receipt in calculating for corporation tax purposes the profits for the period of the trade concerned.
1042I
Redemption of value of expenditure credit
If a company is entitled to, and claims, an R&D expenditure credit for an accounting period, the credit is to be dealt with as follows.
Step 1
The amount of the credit is to be applied in discharging any liability of the company to pay corporation tax for the accounting period.
Step 2
If there is a notional tax deduction (see section 1042K), it is to be applied to any amount remaining after step 1.
Step 3
If the amount remaining after step 2 exceeds the cap by reference to the company’s PAYE and NIC liabilities for the accounting period (see section 1112B), the excess is to be deducted.
Step 4
Any amount remaining after step 3 is to be applied in discharging any liability of the company to pay corporation tax for any other accounting period.
Step 5
If the company is a member of a group, it may surrender the whole or part of any amount remaining after step 4 to any other member of the group (as to which see section 1042N).
Step 6
Any amount remaining after step 5 is to be applied in discharging any other liability of the company to pay a sum to the Commissioners for His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs—
(a)
under or by virtue of an enactment, or
(b)
under an agreement made in connection with any person’s liability to make a payment to the Commissioners under or by virtue of an enactment.
Step 7

1042J
Treatment of deduction to comply with PAYE and NIC limit
(1)
This section applies if an amount is deducted under step 3 in section 1042I.
(2)
The amount is to be added to the amount of R&D expenditure credit to which the company is entitled for its next accounting period (including where that amount would otherwise be nil).
Notional tax deduction
1042K
Amount of notional tax deduction
(1)
This section determines the amount of the notional tax deduction for the purposes of step 2 in section 1042I.
(2)
The amount of the deduction is the amount (if any) by which the amount remaining after step 1 in section 1042I exceeds the amount produced by deducting the notional tax charge from the initial amount of the expenditure credit (that is, its amount before the application of that step).
(3)
Subsections (4) and (5) apply if the trade concerned is not a ring fence trade.
(4)
The notional tax charge is the amount of corporation tax that would be chargeable on the initial amount of the expenditure credit if it were an amount of profits for the accounting period on which corporation tax was chargeable at the applicable rate.
(5)
The applicable rate is—
(a)
the main rate, if the company has profits for the accounting period that—
(i)
are chargeable to corporation tax at the main rate, and
(ii)
would be so even if they did not include any amount brought into account under section 1042H;
(b)
in any other case, the standard small profits rate.
(6)
Subsections (7) and (8) apply if the trade concerned is a ring fence trade.
(7)
The notional tax charge is the sum of—
(a)
the amount of corporation tax that would be chargeable on the initial amount of the expenditure credit if it were an amount of ring fence profits for the accounting period on which corporation tax was chargeable at the applicable rate, and
(b)
the amount of the supplementary charge that would be chargeable on the initial amount of the expenditure credit if it were an amount of adjusted ring fence profits for the accounting period (see Chapters 6 to 9 of Part 8 of CTA 2010).
(8)
The applicable rate is—
(a)
the main ring fence profits rate, if the company has profits for the accounting period that—
(i)
are chargeable to corporation tax at the main ring fence profits rate, and
(ii)
would be so even if they did not include any amount brought into account under section 1042H;
(b)
in any other case, the small ring fence profits rate.
(9)
For the purposes of this section, the initial amount of an expenditure credit is to be treated as excluding any amount added under section 1042J.
(10)

(2)
If the company is a member of a group, it may, in respect of the accounting period in which the expenditure credit arises, surrender the whole or part of the deducted amount to any other member of the group (as to which see section 1042N).
(3)
To the extent that the deducted amount is not surrendered under subsection (2), it is to be applied in discharging any liability of the company to pay corporation tax for any subsequent accounting period.
1042M
Priority of discharge
(1)
An amount within subsection (2) is to be applied as described in that subsection before any amount within subsection (3) is applied as described in that subsection.
(2)
An amount is within this subsection if it is to be applied under—
(a)
section 1042L(3), or
(b)
section 1042N(3) as it applies in relation to an amount surrendered under section 1042L(2),
in discharging the liability of a company to pay corporation tax for an accounting period.
(3)
An amount is within this subsection if it is to be (or would but for subsection (1) be) applied under—
(a)
step 4 in section 1042I, or
(b)
section 1042N(3) as it applies in relation to an amount surrendered under step 5 in section 1042I,
in discharging the same liability as an amount within subsection (2).
Intra-group surrenders
1042N
Amounts surrendered to other group companies
(1)
Subsection (3) applies if an amount of expenditure credit is surrendered by the qualifying company to another member of its group under step 5 in section 1042I or under section 1042L(2).
(2)
For the purposes of that subsection—
(a)
the accounting period in respect of which the surrender is made is “the surrender AP”;
(b)
an accounting period of the other group member is an “overlapping AP” if it overlaps with the surrender AP to any extent.
(3)
The surrendered amount is to be dealt with as follows.
Step 1
Select an overlapping AP.
Step 2
Calculate the proportion of the overlapping AP that overlaps with the surrender AP, and apply that proportion to the amount of corporation tax payable by the other group member for that overlapping AP.
Step 3
Calculate the proportion of the surrender AP that overlaps with the overlapping AP, and apply that proportion to the surrendered amount.
Step 4
The amount given by step 3 is to be applied in discharging the liability of the other group member to pay the corporation tax mentioned in step 2, up to the amount given by that step.
Step 5
Select another overlapping AP, if there is one, and repeat steps 2 to 4.
Step 6
If any of the surrendered amount remains after steps 2 to 4 have been taken in relation to each overlapping AP, the remainder is to be treated for the purposes of section 1042I or (as the case may be) section 1042L(2) as if it had not been surrendered as mentioned in subsection (1).
(4)
A surrender to which subsection (3) applies is not to be—
(a)
taken into account in determining, for corporation tax purposes, the profits or losses of the qualifying company or the other group member, or
(b)
regarded for corporation tax purposes as the making of a distribution.
Basic life assurance and general annuity businesses
1042O
Adaptation of entitlement for certain insurance businesses
(1)
This section applies if—
(a)
for an accounting period, an insurance company is charged to tax in respect of its basic life assurance and general annuity business in accordance with the I-E rules, and
(b)
the calculation of the company’s charge to tax for the period in respect of that business does not involve the calculation of any BLAGAB trade profit or loss of the company.
(2)
The reference in section 1042B(3)(a) to expenditure that is allowable as a deduction in calculating the profits of the trade for an accounting period is to be read as a reference to expenditure that would be so allowable if the company were to calculate its BLAGAB trade profit or loss for the period.
(3)
The reference in section 1042H to calculating the profits of the trade is to be read as a reference to calculating the I-E profit of the basic life assurance and general annuity business carried on by the company.
(4)
Any receipt to be brought into account by virtue of this section is to be treated for the purposes of section 92 of FA 2012 (certain BLAGAB trading receipts to count as deemed I-E receipts) as if it had been taken into account in calculating the company’s BLAGAB trade profit or loss for the period.
(5)
In this section, “BLAGAB trade profit” and “BLAGAB trade loss” have the meanings given by section 136 of FA 2012.”

This Chapter limits the entitlements given by Chapters 1A and 2.
(2)
Sections 1112B to 1112E provide for the amount of R&D expenditure credit or R&D tax credit payable to a company to be capped by reference to certain liabilities of the company in connection with PAYE and national insurance, except in certain cases.
(3)
Sections 1112F and 1112G provide that payment of an R&D expenditure credit, and relief under Chapter 2, are available only to companies that are going concerns.
(4)
Section 1112H provides that an R&D expenditure credit or R&D tax credit does not have to be paid if a tax enquiry into the company is open or the company has outstanding PAYE or national insurance liabilities.
(5)
Section 1112I provides for transactions aimed at obtaining or increasing an entitlement under Chapter 1A or 2 not to succeed in doing so.
(6)
Section 1112J allows the Treasury to place additional limits on the amount of relief available under Chapter 2.
PAYE and NIC liabilities
1112B
Cap by reference to PAYE and NIC liabilities
(1)
This section determines, for the purposes of sections 1042I and 1058(1), the amount of the cap by reference to a company’s PAYE and NIC liabilities for an accounting period.
But see section 1112E (which provides for there to be no cap in certain cases).
(2)
The amount of the cap is the sum of—
(a)
£20,000, and
(b)
the amount produced by multiplying by three (“the multiplier”) the amount of the company’s relevant PAYE and NIC liabilities for payment periods ending in the accounting period (see section 1112C).
(3)
If the accounting period is less than 12 months, the amount specified in subsection (2)(a) is to be proportionately reduced.
(4)
If the company claims relief under both Chapters 1A and 2 for the period, the amount of the cap for the purposes of section 1042I is to be reduced by the amount of any R&D tax credit obtained by the company under Chapter 2.
(5)
The Treasury may by regulations—
(a)
replace the amount for the time being specified in subsection (2)(a) with a different amount;
(b)
replace the multiplier for the time being specified in subsection (2)(b) with a different multiplier.
1112C
Calculation of relevant PAYE and NIC liabilities
(1)
This section determines the amount of a company’s relevant PAYE and NIC liabilities for a payment period for the purposes of section 1112B.
(2)
The amount is to be calculated as follows.
Step 1
Take the total amount of the company’s PAYE and NIC liabilities for the payment period (see section 1112D).
Step 2
Add any amount produced by the application of subsection (4) or (6) to the company as company A.
Step 3
Deduct any amount produced by the application of subsection (4) or (6) to the company as company B.
(3)
An amount is produced by subsection (4) where—
(a)
two companies (“company A” and “company B”) are connected,
(b)
company A incurs expenditure in the payment period on externally provided workers (see sections 1127 and 1128), and
(c)
company B incurs staffing costs in the payment period in providing any of those workers for company A.
(4)
The amount produced is the sum of the amounts given, in relation to each worker in respect of whom subsection (3)(c) is satisfied, by—
where—
X is the amount of expenditure that—
(a)
has been incurred on staffing costs by company B in providing the worker for company A, and
(b)
forms part of the total amount of company B’s PAYE and NIC liabilities for the payment period (see section 1112D),
Y is the amount of company A’s expenditure on the externally provided worker that has been taken into account in calculating the amount of company A’s qualifying expenditure for the payment period, and
Z is the total amount of company A’s qualifying expenditure on the externally provided worker (see section 1127) for the payment period.
(5)
Subsection (6) produces an amount where—

two companies (“company A” and “company B”) are connected,
(b)
company A incurs qualifying contractor expenditure in the payment period, and
(c)
company B incurs staffing costs in the payment period in undertaking on behalf of company A any of the research and development to which that expenditure is attributable.
(6)
That amount is such amount of those staffing costs as forms part of the total amount of company B’s PAYE and NIC liabilities for the payment period (see section 1112D).
(7)
In this section as it applies for the purposes of section 1042I—
“qualifying expenditure” (except in the expression “qualifying expenditure on the externally provided worker”) means expenditure that is qualifying Chapter 1A expenditure by virtue of section 1042D, 1042E or 1042F;
“qualifying contractor expenditure” means expenditure that is qualifying Chapter 1A expenditure by virtue of—

at a time when it is not a going concern.

If a company ceases to be a going concern after making a claim under section 1054, it is treated as if it had not made the claim (and accordingly there is treated as having been no payment of R&D tax credit to carry interest under section 826 of ICTA).
(6)
Subsection (5) does not apply so far as the claim relates to an amount that was paid or applied before the company ceased to be a going concern.

(b)
a corresponding situation under the law of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom exists in relation to the company.
(5)
If—
(a)
a company transfers its trade and research and development to another company that is a member of the same group, and

only by reason of that transfer, the company’s accounts for the period of account in which the transfer took place are not prepared on a going concern basis,
the accounts are to be treated for the purposes of this section as if they were prepared on a going concern basis.

for payment periods ending in the accounting period.
Artificially inflated claims
1112I
Transactions aimed at obtaining credit or relief to be disregarded
(1)
To the extent that a transaction is attributable to arrangements entered into for a disqualifying purpose, it is to be disregarded in ascertaining a company’s entitlement to relief under this Part.
(2)
Arrangements are entered into for a disqualifying purpose if their main purpose, or one of their main purposes, is to enable a company to obtain relief under this Part—
(a)
to which it would not otherwise be entitled, or
(b)
of greater amount than that to which it would otherwise be entitled.
Additional limits

(b)
in determining whether activity is research and development for the purposes of this Part, anything done by one of those companies further to a contract with the other is to be treated as if done by the other company, in any case where that results in activity that would not otherwise be research and development being regarded as such.

(3)
See in particular—

section 1179D, in relation to films and television programmes;
(b)
section 1179F, in relation to video games.
(4)
Whether a company is the qualifying company for a qualifying production (including whether the production is a qualifying production) is to be assessed separately in relation to each accounting period of the company.
(5)
The assessment is to be made by reference to the state of affairs at the end of that period.
(6)
So far as future events are relevant to the assessment, it is to be made by reference to the reasonable expectations of the company at that time.
(7)
Subsections (5) and (6) are subject to any provision of this Part that provides for a production no longer to be regarded as a qualifying production in an accounting period as a result of events after the end of that period.
(8)
Once a qualifying company has made an election under section 1179B(1) in respect of a qualifying production, no other company can subsequently be the qualifying company for that production.
(9)
In this Part, “production”, except when contained in another defined term or used to refer to the act of producing something, means—
(a)
a film (see section 1179DA),
(b)

(1)
In this Part, “company tax return” has the same meaning as in Schedule 18 to FA 1998 (see paragraph 3(1)).

The separate production trade
1179B
Election to tax qualifying production as separate trade
(1)
The qualifying company for a qualifying production may elect in its company tax return for an accounting period for the production to be taxed as a separate trade.
(2)
The effect of such an election is that the activities of the company in relation to the production are to be treated for corporation tax purposes as a trade separate from any other activities of the company (including activities in relation to other qualifying productions).
(3)
In this Part—
(a)
that trade is called “the separate production trade”;
(b)
the accounting period to which the return containing the election relates is called “the opt-in period”.
1179BA
Duration of separate trade

When the qualifying company is treated as beginning to carry on the separate production trade is determined by—
(a)
section 1179DW, in the case of a film or television programme;
(b)
section 1179FO, in the case of a video game.
(2)
If the result is that the separate production trade is treated as having been carried on in an accounting period before the opt-in period, any relevant company tax return must be amended so as to give effect to that treatment in that earlier accounting period.
(3)
Once a company has made an election under section 1179B(1), the activities of the company in relation to the production are to continue to be treated as a separate trade in accordance with this Chapter even if—
(a)
the production ceases to be a qualifying production, or
(b)
the company ceases to be the qualifying company for it.
(4)
That is the case even if the production ceases to be regarded as a qualifying production in the opt-in period as a result of events after the end of that period.
(5)
In the following provisions of this Chapter, “qualifying production” and “qualifying company” are accordingly capable of including productions or companies that used to be so.
Accounting for the separate trade
1179BB
Calculation of profits
(1)
The profits of the separate production trade are to be calculated in accordance with this section.
(2)
For the first period of account, the following are to be brought into account—
(a)
as a debit, the costs of the qualifying production incurred by the qualifying company to date, and
(b)
as a credit, the proportion of the qualifying company’s estimated total income from the qualifying production that is treated as earned at the end of that period.
(3)
For subsequent periods of account, the following are to be brought into account—
(a)
as a debit, the difference between—
(i)
the amount of the costs of the qualifying production incurred by the qualifying company to date, and
(ii)
the corresponding amount for the previous period, and
(b)
as a credit, the difference between—
(i)
the proportion of the qualifying company’s estimated total income from the qualifying production that is treated as earned at the end of that period, and
(ii)
the corresponding amount for the previous period.
(4)
The proportion of the qualifying company’s estimated total income that is treated as earned at the end of a period of account is given by—
where—
C is the total of the costs of the qualifying production incurred by the qualifying company to date,
T is the estimated total cost to the qualifying company of the qualifying production, and
I is the qualifying company’s estimated total income from the qualifying production.
(5)
What counts as costs of, and income from, the qualifying production is determined by—
(a)
section 1179DX, in the case of a film or television programme;
(b)
section 1179FP, in the case of a video game.
(See also section 1179CB.)
(6)
But nothing in this Part, except section 1179BE, allows an amount to count as costs of the qualifying production if it would not generally be allowed as a deduction in calculating the profits of a trade for corporation tax purposes.
(7)
Estimates for the purposes of this section must be made—
(a)
as at the balance sheet date for each period of account, and
(b)
on a just and reasonable basis taking into consideration all relevant circumstances.
(8)
Subsection (9) applies if a period of account of the separate production trade does not coincide with an accounting period of the qualifying company.
(9)
The expenditure and receipts brought into account for the period under this section, and the resulting profit or loss, are to be apportioned to accounting periods of the company for the purposes of this Part by reference to the number of days in the periods concerned.
1179BC
When costs are to be taken as incurred
(1)
For the purposes of section 1179BB, costs are incurred when they are represented in the state of completion of the work in progress.
(2)
Accordingly—
(a)
payments in advance for work to be done are to be ignored until the work has been carried out, and
(b)
deferred payments are to be recognised to the extent that the work is represented in the state of completion.
(3)
But an amount that has not been paid is not an incurred cost until there is an unconditional obligation to pay it.
(4)
If an obligation is linked to income being earned from the qualifying production, no amount is to be brought into account in respect of the costs of the obligation unless an appropriate amount of income is or has been brought into account.
1179BD
Preliminary expenditure
(1)
This section applies if, before the qualifying company began to carry on the separate production trade, it incurred expenditure on the development of the qualifying production.
(2)
The expenditure may be treated as expenditure of the separate production trade incurred immediately after the company began to carry on the trade.
(3)
If expenditure so treated has previously been taken into account for other tax purposes, any relevant company tax return must be amended accordingly.
1179BE
Treatment of certain capital amounts as revenue
(1)
This section applies for corporation tax purposes in relation to the separate production trade.
(2)
Expenditure that—
(a)
counts as costs of the qualifying production, and
(b)
would (apart from this subsection) be regarded as of a capital nature by reason only of being incurred on the creation of an asset in the form of the qualifying production,
is to be treated as expenditure of a revenue nature.
(As to other capital expenditure, see section 53 and section 1179BB(6).)
(3)
Receipts that—
(a)
count as income from the qualifying production, and
(b)
would (apart from this subsection) be regarded as of a capital nature,
are to be treated as receipts of a revenue nature.
Losses in the separate trade
1179BF
Carrying forward of production losses
(1)
This section applies if a company makes a loss in the separate production trade in a pre-completion period (see sections 1179DY and 1179FQ).
(2)
The loss is not available for loss relief, except as provided in subsections (3) and (5).
(3)
The loss is not prevented from being carried forward under section 45B of CTA 2010 to be deducted from profits of the separate production trade in a subsequent period.
(4)
If the loss is so carried forward and deducted, the deduction is to be ignored for the purposes of section 269ZB of CTA 2010.
(5)
To the extent that the loss could be carried forward under section 45B of CTA 2010 to the completion period or a subsequent accounting period, it may instead be treated for the purposes of section 37 and Part 5 of CTA 2010 as a loss made in that period.
(6)
Subsection (5) does not apply to the extent that the loss is carried forward by virtue of section 1179BG.
(7)
In this section, “loss relief” includes any means by which a loss might be used to reduce the amount in respect of which the company, or any other person, is chargeable to tax.
1179BG
Transfer of terminal loss to other qualifying production
(1)
This section applies if—
(a)
a company (“the principal company”) ceases to carry on the separate production trade in respect of a production,
(b)
the principal company could, but for the cessation of that trade, carry an amount (“the terminal loss”) forward under section 45A or 45B of CTA 2010 to an accounting period after that in which the cessation occurs,
(c)
when the trade ceases, either the principal company or another company in the same group carries on another separate production trade under this Chapter (“the other trade”), and
(d)
the ceased trade and the other trade both relate to productions that are or were qualifying productions by virtue of the same Chapter of this Part.
(2)
If the other trade is carried on by the principal company, the company may, by making a claim, treat the terminal loss (or part of it) as a loss made in the other trade that is carried forward under section 45B of CTA 2010.
(3)
If the other trade is carried on by another company—
(a)
the principal company may surrender the terminal loss (or part of it) to the other company, and
(b)
the other company may, by making a claim, elect for the surrendered amount to be treated as a loss made in the other trade that is carried forward under section 45B of CTA 2010.
(4)
The carrying forward of a loss by virtue of subsection (2) or (3) is to the first accounting period beginning after the cessation of the ceased trade.
(5)
If—
(a)
the other trade is no longer carried on that accounting period,
(b)
the company carrying on the other trade is not entitled to an expenditure credit under Chapter 3 for that accounting period in respect of the other trade, or
(c)
in a case within subsection (3), the other company does not make the election in relation to that accounting period,
the claim under subsection (2) or the surrender under subsection (3) is to be treated as not having been made.
(6)
The Treasury may, in relation to surrenders or elections under subsection (3), make provision by regulations corresponding, subject to such adaptations or modifications as appear to them to be appropriate, to that made by Part 8 of Schedule 18 to the FA 1998.
(7)
A deduction made under section 45B of CTA 2010 by virtue of this section is to be ignored for the purposes of section 269ZB of CTA 2010.
(8)
The principal company is not entitled to relief under section 45F of CTA 2010 in respect of an amount surrendered under subsection (3).
Chapter 3
Expenditure credit
The entitlement
1179C
Entitlement to expenditure credit
(1)
The qualifying company for a qualifying production is entitled to an expenditure credit for—
(a)
the opt-in period, and
(b)
(subject to subsection (2)) any subsequent accounting period in which it continues to carry on the separate production trade.
(2)
If in any of those subsequent periods the production is no longer a qualifying production, or the company is no longer the qualifying company for it, the company is not entitled to an expenditure credit for the period.
(3)
But that does not affect the entitlement of the company for any subsequent period in which the production is once again a qualifying production or the company is once again the qualifying company for it.
(4)
If a production ceases to be regarded as a qualifying production in an accounting period as a result of events after the end of that period—
(a)
the qualifying company is no longer entitled to an expenditure credit for that period, and
(b)
any company tax return drawn up in reliance on such an entitlement must be amended so as to remove anything derived from that entitlement.
(5)
An expenditure credit to which a company is entitled may be claimed by the company in accordance with Part 9D of Schedule 18 to FA 1998.
1179CA
Amount of expenditure credit
(1)
The amount of the expenditure credit to which a qualifying company is entitled for an accounting period is determined as follows.
Step 1
Ascertain the total of the company’s relevant global expenditure (see subsection (2)) for all accounting periods up to and including the present one.
Step 2
Deduct from that total any expenditure that is not UK expenditure (see section 1179AB).
Step 3
If the amount remaining after step 2 exceeds 80% of the total ascertained at step 1, deduct the amount of the excess.
The remaining amount is the company’s “qualifying expenditure to date”.
Step 4
Deduct from the company’s qualifying expenditure to date the amount (if any) that was the company’s qualifying expenditure to date in the accounting period for which it was last entitled to, and claimed, an expenditure credit in respect of the qualifying production.
The remaining amount is the company’s “qualifying expenditure for the period”.
Step 5
The amount of the credit to which the company is entitled is the relevant percentage of the company’s qualifying expenditure for the period.
The relevant percentage is determined by—
(a)
section 1179DV, in the case of a film or television programme;
(b)
section 1179FN, in the case of a video game.
(2)
Expenditure is “relevant global expenditure” for an accounting period if—
(a)
it is brought into account under section 1179BB in calculating the profits of the separate production trade for that period, and
(b)
it counts as relevant production expenditure in relation to the qualifying production under—
(i)
section 1179DR, in the case of a film or television programme;
(ii)
section 1179FJ, in the case of a video game.
Treatment of credit
1179CB
Expenditure credit to count as taxable receipt
(1)
An expenditure credit under this Chapter is not to be treated as income for the purposes of section 1179BB.
(2)
But if a company is entitled to, and claims, an expenditure credit under this Chapter for an accounting period, the profits of the separate production trade for that period must (having first been calculated in accordance with section 1179BB) be adjusted by bringing the amount of the expenditure credit into account as a credit.
1179CC
Redemption of value of expenditure credit
If a company is entitled to, and claims, an expenditure credit under this Chapter for an accounting period, the credit is to be dealt with as follows.
Step 1
The amount of the credit is to be applied in discharging any liability of the company to pay corporation tax for the accounting period.
Step 2
Any amount remaining after step 1 is to be reduced, if necessary, to the amount given by—
where—
A is the initial amount of the credit (before step 1), and
B is the amount of corporation tax that would be chargeable on that amount if it were an amount of profits for the accounting period on which corporation tax was chargeable at the main rate.
For provision about the treatment of an amount deducted under this step, see section 1179CD.
Step 3
The amount remaining after step 2 is to be applied in discharging any liability of the company to pay corporation tax for any other accounting period.
Step 4
If the company is a member of a group, it may surrender the whole or part of any amount remaining after step 3 to any other member of the group (as to which see section 1179CE).
Step 5
Any amount remaining after step 4 is to be applied in discharging any other liability of the company to pay a sum to the Commissioners for His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs—
(a)
under or by virtue of an enactment, or
(b)
under an agreement made in connection with any person’s liability to make a payment to the Commissioners under or by virtue of an enactment.
Step 6
Any amount remaining after step 5 is (subject to sections 1179CG and 1179CH) to be paid to the company by an officer of Revenue and Customs.
1179CD
Treatment of notional tax deduction
(1)
This section applies if an amount is deducted under step 2 in section 1179CC from the amount of the qualifying company’s expenditure credit.
(2)
If the qualifying company is a member of a group, it may, in respect of the accounting period for which the expenditure credit arises, surrender the whole or part of the deducted amount to any other member of the group (as to which see section 1179CE).
(3)
To the extent that the deducted amount is not surrendered under subsection (2), it is to be carried forward to the next accounting period of the qualifying company, and subsections (4) and (5) apply.
(4)
The carried-forward amount is to be applied in discharging any liability of the qualifying company to pay corporation tax for the accounting period.
(5)
If—
(a)
any of the carried-forward amount remains after the application of subsection (4), and
(b)
the qualifying company is a member of a group,
the qualifying company may, in respect of the accounting period, surrender the whole or part of the remaining amount to any other member of the group (as to which see section 1179CE).
(6)
If any of the carried-forward amount remains after the application of subsections (4) and (5), it is to be carried forward to the next accounting period of the qualifying company, and those subsections apply again in relation to that accounting period.
1179CE
Amounts surrendered to other group companies
(1)
Subsection (3) applies if an amount of expenditure credit is surrendered by the qualifying company to another member of its group under step 4 in section 1179CC or under section 1179CD(2) or (5).
(2)
For the purposes of that subsection—
(a)
the accounting period in respect of which the surrender is made is “the surrender AP”;
(b)
an accounting period of the other group member is an “overlapping AP” if it overlaps to any extent with the surrender AP.
(3)
The surrendered amount is to be dealt with as follows.
Step 1
Select an overlapping AP.
Step 2
Calculate the proportion of the overlapping AP that overlaps with the surrender AP, and apply that proportion to the amount of corporation tax payable by the other group member for that overlapping AP.
Step 3
Calculate the proportion of the surrender AP that overlaps with the overlapping AP, and apply that proportion to the surrendered amount.
Step 4
The amount given by step 3 is to be applied in discharging the liability of the other group member to pay the corporation tax mentioned in step 2, up to the amount given by that step.
Step 5
Select another overlapping AP, if there is one, and repeat steps 2 to 4.
Step 6
If any of the surrendered amount remains after steps 2 to 4 have been taken in relation to each overlapping AP, the remainder is to be treated for the purposes of section 1179CC or (as the case may be) section 1179CD as if it had not been surrendered as mentioned in subsection (1).
(4)
A surrender to which subsection (3) applies is not to be—
(a)
taken into account in determining, for corporation tax purposes, the profits of the qualifying company or the other group member, or
(b)
regarded for corporation tax purposes as the making of a distribution.
1179CF
Priority of discharge
(1)
An amount within subsection (2) is to be applied as described in that subsection before any amount within subsection (3) is applied as described in that subsection.
(2)
An amount is within this subsection if it is to be applied under—
(a)
section 1179CD(4), or
(b)
section 1179CE(3) as it applies in relation to an amount surrendered under section 1179CD(2) or (5),
in discharging the liability of a company to pay corporation tax for an accounting period.
(3)
An amount is within this subsection if it is to be (or would but for subsection (1) be) applied under—
(a)
section 1179CC, or
(b)
section 1179CE(3) as it applies in relation to an amount surrendered under section 1179CC,
in discharging the same liability as an amount within subsection (2).

(b)
the company’s tax return for the accounting period in question is enquired into by an officer of Revenue and Customs.

Subsection (4) applies if—
(a)
a company would (but for that subsection) be entitled to be paid an amount at step 6 of section 1179CC, and

Artificial arrangements
1179CI
Disqualifying arrangements and non-commercial transactions
(1)
Subsections (2) and (3) apply if, at any time, a company is party to disqualifying arrangements in relation to anything that is, was or becomes a qualifying production (“the production”).
(2)
The company is not entitled to an expenditure credit under this Chapter in respect of the production for any accounting period.
(3)
Any relevant company tax return must be amended accordingly.
(4)
Subsection (5) applies if a transaction—
(a)
is attributable to arrangements (other than disqualifying arrangements) entered into otherwise than for genuine commercial reasons, and
(b)
would result in a company obtaining a relevant advantage.
(5)
The relevant advantage is to be counteracted by the making of just and reasonable adjustments to any amounts relevant to the calculation of the company’s entitlement to an expenditure credit under this Chapter.
(6)
Those adjustments may be made (for example) by way of amendment, assessment, or modification of an assessment.
(7)
For the purposes of this section, arrangements are disqualifying arrangements if their main purpose, or one of their main purposes, is to enable the company to obtain a relevant advantage.
(8)
But such arrangements are not disqualifying arrangements if the obtaining of that advantage as a result of the arrangements could reasonably be regarded as consistent with—
(a)
the principles (whether expressed or implied) on which the provisions of this Part are based, and
(b)
the policy objectives of those provisions.
(9)
For the purposes of this section, a company would obtain a relevant advantage if it would become entitled to an expenditure credit under this Chapter—

(4)
Subsections (2) and (3) are subject to subsections (5) and (6).

Accounting for the separate trade
1179FO
When the separate trade begins
For the purposes of section 1179B, the development company for a video game is treated as beginning the separate production trade in respect of the video game—
(a)
when the design of the video game begins,
(b)
if earlier, when any income from the video game is received by the company.
1179FP
Costs and income of separate trade
(1)
This section applies for the purposes of section 1179BB as that section applies in relation to a video game.
(2)
Expenditure counts towards the costs of the video game if it is expenditure on—
(a)
development activities in connection with the video game, or
(b)
activities with a view to exploiting the video game.
(3)
But an amount that has not been paid within the period of 4 months beginning with the first day after the final day of a period of account is not to count towards the costs incurred in that period.
(4)
Receipts count towards the income from the video game if they are receipts in connection with the production or exploitation of the video game, including—
(a)
receipts from the sale of the video game or rights in it,
(b)
royalties or other payments for use of the video game, or aspects of it (for example, characters or music),
(c)
payments for rights to produce games or other merchandise, and
(d)
receipts by way of a profit share agreement.
1179FQ
Accounting periods
(1)
A reference to an accounting period, in relation to a video game, is a reference to an accounting period of the development company for the video game.
(2)
A reference to the “completion period”, in relation to a video game, is a reference to the accounting period in which—
(a)
the video game is completed (see section 1179FS), or
(b)
the development company abandons development activities in relation to the video game.
(3)
The development company for a video game must, in its company tax return for the completion period, state whichever of those has occurred.
(4)
A reference to a “pre-completion period”, in relation to a video game, is a reference to any accounting period before the completion period in relation to that video game.
(5)
In this section, “development company” includes a company that is no longer the development company for the video game but is still carrying on the separate production trade in relation to it.
Miscellaneous
1179FR
Meaning of “development activities”
“Development activities”, in relation to a video game, means the activities involved in designing, producing and testing the video game.
1179FS
When video game is completed
A video game is “completed” when it is first in a form in which it can reasonably be regarded as ready for copies of it to be made and made available to the general public.”

(5)
For the purposes of sub-paragraph (4), an entitlement to a tax credit under section 1217H of CTA 2009 derives from expenditure incurred before 1 April 2025 to the extent that it would arise if only costs incurred and income received before that date were taken into account in calculating the surrenderable loss of the company for the purposes of section 1217KA of that Act.

(3)
Sub-paragraph (4) applies in a case where expenditure incurred before 1 April 2024 is to be taken into account as qualifying expenditure for the purposes of section 1217J of CTA 2009 (amount of relief for theatrical production).
(4)
The references in subsections (2) and (3) of that section (as amended by paragraph 6) to so much of the qualifying expenditure incurred to date as is UK expenditure are to be read as references to so much of the qualifying expenditure incurred to date as—
(a)
has been incurred before 1 April 2024 and is European expenditure, or
(b)
has been incurred on or after that date and is UK expenditure.
(5)
But if the theatrical production in relation to which sub-paragraph (4) applies has entered production before 1 April 2024, the production company may elect for that sub-paragraph to have effect in relation to that production as if “2025” were substituted for “2024”.

(a)
if the sums or assets applied in (or in connection with) the purchase of the annuity or any related dependants’ annuity or any related nominees’ annuity consist of, or include, sums or assets representing the whole or part of the member’s drawdown pension fund or of the member's flexi-access drawdown fund, the aggregate of those sums and the market value of those assets, and
(b)
in any case, so much (if any) of the sums or assets applied in (or in connection with) the purchase of the annuity or any related dependants’ annuity or any related nominees’ annuity as represents rights which are attributable to a disqualifying pension credit.

the sole or main purpose of the relevant surrender or relevant transfer is to increase the applicable amount for the purposes of paragraph 2 on the member becoming entitled to a scheme pension, and
(c)
the member becomes entitled to a scheme pension under a relevant defined benefits arrangement.
(2)
The pension scheme under which the relevant defined benefits arrangement is an arrangement is to be treated as making an unauthorised payment to the member of the amount by which—

member money purchase funds are subject to a “relevant surrender” if they are surrendered and, in consequence of the surrender, there is a corresponding increase in the sums or assets held for the purposes of, or representing rights under, a defined benefits arrangement relating to the member under the pension scheme (or such an arrangement is established), and
(b)
member money purchase funds are subject to a “relevant transfer” if they are transferred so as to become held for the purposes of, or to represent rights under, a defined benefits arrangement relating to the member under any other registered pension scheme.

(a)
the defined benefits arrangement mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) of sub-paragraph (3), or

“Pension commencement excess lump sum
3C
(1)
For the purposes of this Part a lump sum is a pension commencement excess lump sum if—
(a)
the member becomes entitled to it in connection with becoming entitled to a relevant pension (or dies after becoming entitled to it but before becoming entitled to the relevant pension in connection with which it was anticipated that the member would become entitled to it);
(b)
it is paid when none of the member’s lump sum allowance is available (see paragraph 12A);
(c)
it is paid within the period beginning six months before, and ending one year after, the day on which the member becomes entitled to it;
(d)
it does not reduce the rate of payment of any pension to which the member has become (actually) entitled, or extinguish the member’s entitlement to payment of any such pension;
(e)
it is paid when the member has reached normal minimum pension age (or the ill-health condition is met); and
(f)
it is not an excluded lump sum (see sub-paragraph (4)).
(2)
But if a lump sum falling within sub-paragraph (1) exceeds the permitted maximum, the excess is not a pension commencement excess lump sum.
(3)
In this paragraph “the permitted maximum”, in relation to a lump sum, means—
where—
“A” is the applicable amount in relation to the relevant pension (see paragraphs 2A to 2D);
“B” is the amount of the member’s lump sum and death benefit allowance that is available on the payment of the lump sum (see paragraph 12A).
(4)
A lump sum is an “excluded lump sum” if—
(a)
it would, apart from this paragraph, be permitted to be paid under the lump sum rule in section 166, or
(b)
the pension in connection with which the member becomes entitled to it is a CMP-derived drawdown pension.
(5)
In determining for the purposes of this paragraph—
(a)
whether any of a member’s lump sum allowance is available on the payment of a lump sum, or
(b)
the amount of a member’s lump sum and death benefit allowance that is available on the payment of a lump sum,
the member is treated as having already become entitled to any pension commencement lump sum that is paid to the member in connection with becoming entitled to the relevant pension.”

For Chapter 15A substitute—
“Chapter 15A
Lump sums under registered pension schemes
Introduction
637
Introduction
(1)
This Chapter makes provision about the income tax treatment of authorised lump sums and authorised lump sum death benefits.
(2)
In this Chapter—
(a)
“authorised lump sum” means a lump sum permitted by the lump sum rule in section 166 of FA 2004 to be paid by a registered pension scheme to a member of the scheme;
(b)
“authorised lump sum death benefit” means a lump sum death benefit permitted by the lump sum death benefit rule in section 168 of that Act to be paid by a registered pension scheme in respect of a member of the scheme.
(3)
Expressions used in this Chapter and Part 4 of FA 2004 (pensions etc) have the same meaning in this Chapter as in that Part.
Tax treatment of authorised lump sums
637A
Pension commencement lump sums
No liability to income tax arises on a pension commencement lump sum paid under a registered pension scheme.
637B
Pension commencement excess lump sums
A person to whom a pension commencement excess lump sum is paid under a registered pension scheme is treated as having taxable pension income for the tax year in which the payment is made equal to the amount of the lump sum.
637C
Serious ill-health lump sums
(1)
Subject to subsections (2) and (4), no liability to income tax arises on a serious ill-health lump sum paid under a registered pension scheme.
(2)
If—
(a)
a serious ill-health lump sum is paid under a registered pension scheme to a member who (at the time of the payment) is under 75, and
(b)
the lump sum exceeds the permitted maximum,
section 579A (pensions) applies to the excess as it applies to any pension under a registered pension scheme.
(3)
In subsection (2) “the permitted maximum”, in relation to a serious ill-health lump sum paid to a member, means so much of the member’s lump sum and death benefit allowance as is available immediately before the member becomes entitled to the lump sum (see section 637S).
(4)
If a serious ill-health lump sum is paid under a registered pension scheme to a member who (at the time of the payment) is 75 or over, section 579A (pensions) applies to the lump sum as it applies to any pension under a registered pension scheme.
637D
Uncrystallised funds pension lump sums
(1)
Subject to subsection (2), where an uncrystallised funds pension lump sum is paid under a registered pension scheme—
(a)
no liability to income tax arises on 25% of the lump sum, and
(b)
section 579A (pensions) applies in relation to the remainder of the lump sum as it applies to any pension under a registered pension scheme.
(2)
If—
(a)
an uncrystallised funds pension lump sum is paid under a registered pension scheme, and
(b)
25% of the lump sum is an amount that exceeds the permitted maximum,
section 579A (pensions) applies to the excess as it applies to any pension under a registered pension scheme.
(3)
In subsection (2) “the permitted maximum”, in relation to an uncrystallised funds pension lump sum paid to a member, means the lower of the following amounts—
(a)
so much of the member’s lump sum allowance as is available immediately before the member becomes entitled to the lump sum (see section 637Q);
(b)
so much of the member’s lump sum and death benefit allowance as is available immediately before the member becomes entitled to the lump sum (see section 637S).
637E
Short service refund lump sum
A short service refund lump paid under a registered pension scheme is subject to income tax in accordance with section 205 of FA 2004 (charge to tax on scheme administrator in respect of such a lump sum) but not otherwise.
637F
Refund of excess contributions lump sums
No liability to income tax arises on a refund of excess contributions lump sum paid under a registered pension scheme.
637G
Trivial commutation lump sums and winding-up lump sums
(1)
Subject to subsection (2), a member of a registered pension scheme to whom—
(a)
a trivial commutation lump sum, or
(b)
a winding-up lump sum,
is paid under the scheme is treated as having taxable pension income for the tax year in which the payment is made equal to the amount of the lump sum.
(2)
If, immediately before the lump sum is paid, the member has uncrystallised rights under any one or more arrangements under the pension scheme, the amount of the taxable pension income is reduced by the tax-free element (if any).
(3)
In subsection (2) “the tax-free element” means 25% of the value of any uncrystallised rights extinguished by the lump sum.
(4)
In this section “uncrystallised rights” has the same meaning as in section 212 of FA 2004; and the value for the purposes of this section of any uncrystallised rights is to be calculated in accordance with that section.
Tax treatment of authorised lump sum death benefits
637H
Defined benefits lump sum death benefits
(1)
Subject to subsections (2) to (6), no liability to income tax arises on a defined benefits lump sum death benefit paid under a registered pension scheme.
(2)
If—
(a)
a defined benefits lump sum death benefit under a registered pension scheme is paid in respect of a member who, on death, is under 75,
(b)
the lump sum is paid before the end of the relevant two year period, and
(c)
the lump sum exceeds the permitted maximum,
section 579A (pensions) applies to the excess as it applies to any pension under a registered pension scheme.
(3)
If—
(a)
a defined benefits lump sum death benefit under a registered pension scheme is paid in respect of a member who, on death, is under 75,
(b)
the lump sum is not paid before the end of the relevant two year period, and
(c)
the lump sum is paid to a qualifying person,
section 579A (pensions) applies to the lump sum as it applies to any pension under a registered pension scheme.
(4)
If—
(a)
a defined benefits lump sum death benefit under a registered pension scheme is paid in respect of a member who, on death, is under 75,
(b)
the lump sum is not paid before the end of the relevant two year period, and
(c)
the lump sum is paid to a non-qualifying person,
the lump sum is subject to income tax under section 206 of FA 2004 (special lump sum death benefits charge on scheme administrator) but not otherwise.
(5)
If a defined benefits lump sum death benefit under a registered pension scheme is paid—
(a)
in respect of a member who, on death, is 75 or over, and
(b)
to a qualifying person,
section 579A (pensions) applies to the lump sum as it applies to any pension under a registered pension scheme.
(6)
If a defined benefits lump sum death benefit under a registered pension scheme is paid—
(a)
in respect of a member who, on death, is 75 or over, and
(b)
to a non-qualifying person,
the lump sum is subject to income tax under section 206 of FA 2004 (special lump sum death benefits charge on scheme administrator) but not otherwise.
(7)
In this section—
“non-qualifying person” has the same meaning as in section 206 of FA 2004;
“the permitted maximum”, in relation to a defined benefits lump sum death benefit paid in respect of a member, means so much of the member’s lump sum and death benefit allowance as is available immediately before the lump sum is paid (see section 637S);
“qualifying person” means a person who is not a non-qualifying person;
“the relevant two year period” means the period of two years beginning with the day on which the scheme administrator of the scheme first knew of the member’s death or (if earlier) the day on which the scheme administrator could first reasonably have been expected to have known of it.
637I
Pension protection lump sum death benefits
(1)
Subject to subsections (2), (3) and (4) no liability to income tax arises on a pension protection lump sum death benefit paid under a registered pension scheme.
(2)
If—

a pension protection lump sum death benefit under a registered pension scheme is paid in respect of a member who, on death, is under 75, and
(b)
the lump sum exceeds the permitted maximum,
section 579A (pensions) applies to the excess as it applies to any pension under a registered pension scheme.
(3)
If a pension protection lump sum death benefit under a registered pension scheme is paid—
(a)
in respect of a member who, on death, is 75 or over, and

a transfer to a QROPS is made that is—
(i)
within section 244AC(2)(a) or (b), or
(ii)
an onward transfer within section 244AC(2)(c) in relation to which the original transfer is a transfer within paragraph (b) of the definition of “original transfer” (see section 244AB(1)),
(b)
the transfer is excluded from the charge under section 244AC by or under any of sections 244B to 244H, and
(c)
the transferred value (determined in accordance with section 244K) exceeds the amount of the member’s overseas transfer allowance that is available on the making of the transfer.

The overseas transfer charge also arises where—
(a)
a transfer of the kind mentioned in subsection (1)(a) is made to a QROPS,
(b)
a charge under section 244AC (“the original charge”) arises in relation to the transfer,
(c)

Member’s overseas transfer allowance
A member’s “overseas transfer allowance” is an amount equal to the member’s lump sum and death benefit allowance.
244IC
Availability of member’s overseas transfer allowance
(1)
This section is about the availability of a member’s overseas transfer allowance on the making of a transfer of the kind mentioned in section 244IA(1)(a) (“the current overseas transfer”).
(2)
If no transfer of the kind mentioned in section 244IA(1)(a) has been made in relation to the member before the current overseas transfer, the whole of the member’s overseas transfer allowance is available.
(3)
Otherwise, the amount of the member’s overseas transfer allowance that is available is—
(a)
so much of that allowance as is left after deducting the previously-used amount, or
(b)
if none is left after deducting that amount, nil.
(4)
For this purpose “the previously-used amount” is the aggregate of the transferred value (determined in accordance with section 244K) of each transfer (if any) of the kind mentioned in section 244IA(1)(a) that has been made in relation to the member before the current overseas transfer.
(5)
A reference in this section to a transfer of the kind mentioned in section 244IA(1)(a) is to a transfer made on or after 6 April 2024.”

qualifying refundable tax credits are accounted for as income rather than as tax expense,

(3)
After that section insert—
“148A
Transferable tax credits
(1)
A tax credit is a transferable tax credit in relation to a member of a multinational group if—
(a)
the member is—
(i)
the person to whom the credit was originally granted (“the originator”), or
(ii)
a person (“a purchaser”) who has acquired the credit (whether from the originator or anyone else), and
(b)
the transferability condition is met in relation to the member.
(2)
A transferable tax credit is a marketable transferable tax credit in relation to a member of a multinational group if—
(a)
it is a transferable tax credit, and
(b)
the marketable condition is met in relation to the member.
(3)
Those conditions are met differently depending on whether the member is the originator or a purchaser.
(4)
The transferability condition is met—
(a)
in relation to the originator if, under the law of the territory in which the credit was granted, credits of that type may be transferred to a person or entity that is not connected with originator before the end of 15 months after the end of the accounting period in which the credit is granted, and
(b)
in relation to a purchaser if, under the law of that territory, credits of that type may be transferred to a person or entity that is not connected with the purchaser—
(i)
under the same or similar conditions as would apply to the originator, and
(ii)
before the end of the accounting period in which it was transferred to the purchaser.
(5)
The marketable condition is met—
(a)
in relation to the originator, if—
(i)
the credit is transferred to a person or entity that is not connected with the originator before the end of 15 months of the accounting period in which the credit was granted at a price equal to or in excess of 80% of its net present value, or
(ii)
similar credits are traded between persons or entities that are not connected to each other before the end of 15 months of the accounting period in which they are granted, and are typically traded at a price equal to or in excess of 80% of their net present value, and
(b)
in relation to a purchaser, if the purchaser acquired the credit from a person or entity that is not connected to the purchaser at a price equal to or in excess of 80% of its net present value.
(6)
Subsections (7) and (8) apply for the purposes of determining the net present value of a tax credit.
(7)
In making that determination, assume that the entity that holds it will be able to use it in the accounting periods in which it may be used.
(8)
The discount rate to be used in making that determination is to be determined by reference to the return on debt instruments that are issued by the government of the territory in which the credit was granted—
(a)
that have—
(i)
the same, or a similar, maturity to the period over which the credit is to be used, or
(ii)
in a case in which the credit is to be used over a period exceeding 5 years, a maturity of 5 years, and
(b)
that are issued—
(i)
in relation to a credit that has been transferred, in the accounting period in which the credit was transferred, or
(ii)
in relation to a credit held that has not been transferred, in the accounting period in which it was granted.
(9)
References in subsections (6) and (8) to an accounting period are—
(a)
in relation to determining net present value in connection with determining whether the marketable condition is met by the originator, an accounting period of the originator, and
(b)
in relation to determining net present value in connection with determining whether the marketable condition is met by a purchaser, an accounting period of the purchaser.
(10)
Where a transferable tax credit is also a qualifying refundable tax credit, it is to be treated as not being a transferable tax credit for the purposes of this Part.
148B
Value of marketable transferable tax credits: originator
(1)
The underlying profits of a member of a multinational group that is the originator in relation to a marketable transferable tax credit are to be adjusted to secure that the value of marketable transferable tax credits it holds, and has held, as originator are reflected as follows.
(2)
Where the credit is not transferred before the end of 15 months after the end of the accounting period in which it was granted, the full value of the credit is to be recognised as income.
(3)
Where the credit is subsequently transferred for consideration which is less than the value of the credit, the difference between the value of the credit and the consideration received for its transfer is to be recognised as a loss in the accounting period in which it is transferred.
(4)
Where the credit is transferred before the end of 15 months after the end of the accounting period in which the credit is granted, the consideration for the transfer (rather than the value of the credit) is to be recognised as income.
(5)
Where the credit has not been transferred, and was not fully used, before its expiry, the value of so much of the credit as has not been used is to be reflected as a loss in the accounting period in which the credit expired.
148C
Value of marketable transferable tax credits: purchaser

That amount is the amount given by subtracting—
(a)
the sum of—
(i)
the purchase price of the credit, and
(ii)
any amounts recognised as income in accordance with subsection (2) (whether in that accounting period or a previous accounting period), from
(b)
the sum of—
(i)
the amount of the credit that has been used, and
(ii)
the consideration for the transfer.
(6)

(a)
the amount of the credit that was used, from
(b)
the sum of the purchase price of the credit and any amounts recognised in accordance with subsection (2).”

Tax equity partnerships

(1)
After section 176C (as inserted by paragraph 8), insert—
“Tax equity partnerships
176D
Tax credits etc allocated under tax equity partnerships
(1)
Where—
(a)
a member of a multinational group is an investor in a tax equity partnership arrangement, and
(b)
an election under section 165 (excluded equity gains and losses included) applies in relation to the member for an accounting period,
qualifying flow-through tax benefits provided to the member under that arrangement in that period are to be excluded from the covered tax balance of that member for that period.
(2)
“Flow-through tax benefits” means tax credits, other than qualifying refundable tax credits, and the value of amounts of tax deductible losses made available to be used by an investor in a tax equity partnership arrangement under that arrangement (whether or not those credits or losses are used by the investor).
(3)
Section 176E (proportional amortisation method) applies for the purposes of determining the extent to which flow-through tax benefits are “qualifying” where—
(a)
in determining the underlying profits of the investor, the proportional amortisation method is used to account for the arrangement, or
(b)
the filing member of the multinational group of which the investor is a member has elected that section 176D should apply for those purposes in relation to the member.
(4)
Otherwise, section 176F (subtraction method) applies for those purposes.
(5)
For the purposes of this Part, a member of a multinational group is an investor in a tax equity partnership arrangement if—
(a)
the member has made an investment in an entity that is tax transparent in the territory in which the member is located,
(b)
the investment is treated as an equity interest for tax purposes in the territory in which the member is located,
(c)
the investment would, under an authorised accounting standard of the territory in which the entity operates, be treated as an equity interest,
(d)
the entity is not a member of the multinational group, and
(e)
it is reasonable to expect, at the time of making the investment, that the return on the investment would be negative in the absence of the provision of flow-through tax benefits.
(6)
But a member of a multinational group is not to be regarded as an investor in a tax equity partnership arrangement if—
(a)
the investment in the entity does not represent a genuine economic interest in that entity such that the member is exposed to the possibility of a loss on the investment, or
(b)
the territory in which the member is located limits the use of tax equity partnership arrangements to arrangements that involve a multinational group subject to multinational top-up tax or its equivalent under the law of a territory outside the United Kingdom.
(7)
Flow-through tax benefits provided to a member of a multinational group in an accounting period that are not qualifying are to be reflected as a credit in the covered tax balance for that period.
(8)
Flow-through tax benefits (whether qualifying or not) provided to a member of a multinational group are not to be reflected in the underlying profits of that member, even if that would be the effect of the election under section 165.
(9)
For the purposes of subsection (3)(a), the “proportional amortisation method” means a method of accounting under which—
(a)
the initial capital investment in the arrangement is amortised over the term of the investment with the amortisation expense for an accounting period based on the proportion of the flow-through tax benefits expected to be provided over the term of the arrangement that are expected to be provided in that period, and
(b)
the difference between the flow-through tax benefits received in an accounting period and that amortisation expense for that period is reflected as tax expense.
(10)
For the purposes of this section and sections 176E and 176F, the value of an amount of tax deductible losses made available to be used by an investor is given by multiplying the amount multiplied by the tax rate that applies to the investor.
(11)
Paragraph 2 of Schedule 15 (annual elections) applies to an election under subsection (3)(b).
176E
Flow-through tax benefits: proportional amortisation method
(1)
Where this section applies, to determine the extent to which flow-through tax benefits provided to an investor in an accounting period under a tax equity partnership arrangement are qualifying, take the following steps—
Step 1
Determine the amount of capital investment provided by the investor to the arrangement at its commencement.
Step 2
Divide the flow-through through tax benefits provided under the arrangement in the accounting period by the total flow-through tax benefits expected to be provided over the whole term of the arrangement.
Step 3
Multiply the result of Step 1 by the result of Step 2.
Step 4
Add the following together—
(a)
the amounts, if any, of tax credits made available to be used by the investor under the arrangement in the accounting period;
(b)
the value of the amounts, if any, of tax deductible losses made available to be used by the investor under the arrangement in the accounting period;
(c)
the amounts, if any, of distributions made to the investor in the accounting period;
(d)
the amounts, if any, received by the investor for the sale of any part of its investment in the arrangement in the accounting period.
Step 5
If the result of Step 3 is equal to or greater than the result of Step 4, all of the flow-through tax benefits provided under the arrangement in the accounting period are qualifying.
Otherwise proceed to Step 6.
Step 6
Subtract the result of Step 3 from the result of Step 4.
Step 7
The amount of the flow-through benefits provided under the arrangement in the accounting period that is qualifying is the amount given by reducing the amount of those benefits (but not below nil) by the result of Step 6.
(2)
Accordingly, the amount by which those benefits are reduced in accordance with Step 7 represents non-qualifying flow-through tax benefits which are to be reflected as a credit in the investor’s covered tax balance.
176F
Flow-through tax benefits: subtraction method
Where this section applies, to determine the extent to which flow-through tax benefits provided to an investor in an accounting period under a tax equity partnership arrangement are qualifying, take the following steps—
Step 1
Determine the amount of capital investment provided by the investor to the arrangement at its commencement.
Step 2
Subtract the following from that amount—
(a)
the amounts, if any, of tax credits made available to be used by the investor under the arrangement since the commencement of the arrangement, other than tax credits that are not qualifying refundable tax credits that were made available in the accounting period;
(b)
the value of the amounts, if any, of tax deductible losses made available to be used by the investor under the arrangement since its commencement, other than losses made available in the accounting period;
(c)
the amounts, if any, of distributions made to the investor since the arrangement’s commencement;
(d)
the amounts, if any, received by the investor for the sale of any part of its investment in the arrangement.
Step 3
If the result of Step 2 is nil or less, no flow-through tax benefits provided under arrangement in the accounting period are qualifying.
If the result of that step is more than nil, proceed to Step 4.
Step 4
Subtract the flow-through tax benefits provided to the investor in the accounting period under the arrangement from the result of Step 2.
Step 5
If the result of Step 4 is nil or greater, all of the flow-through tax benefits provided under the arrangement in the accounting period are qualifying.
Otherwise, the amount of those benefits that is qualifying is the amount of those benefits that when subtracted from the result of Step 2 would give a result of nil.”

In Schedule 15 (elections), in paragraph 2(1), before paragraph (a) insert—

But where the property is not a short-term rental asset for that period, any carrying value of the operating lease recorded at the start or the end of the period is to be reduced by the right-of-use amount for the property at that time for the purposes of carrying out the calculation in section 197(1).
(4)
In a case where the lessee is a member of the same multinational group as the lessor, the right-of-use amount in relation to the property at the start or the end of the period is the carrying value of the lessee’s right-of-use asset in relation to the property recorded at that time.
(5)
Where the lessee is not a member of the same multinational group as the lessor, the right-of-use amount in relation to the property at the start or end of the period is the undiscounted value of any outstanding payments under the lease at that time.
(6)
In determining the value of those outstanding payments—
(a)
apply the accounting standard used in determining the underlying profits of the member,
(b)
include the value of any outstanding payments that would be due under any extension to the lease that would fall to be accounted for in accordance with that standard.
(7)
For the purposes of this section, property held for lease is a short-term rental asset in an accounting period if—
(a)
the property was leased regularly during that period to different lessees, and
(b)
the average length of the periods for which it was leased does not exceed 30 days.”
