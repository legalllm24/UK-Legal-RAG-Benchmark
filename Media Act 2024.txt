(4)
The public service remit for television in the United Kingdom is fulfilled where the public service broadcasters (taken together) make available a broad range of audiovisual content—
(a)
in a manner which, taking into account when and how their relevant audiovisual services are received or accessed, is likely to meet the needs and satisfy the interests of as many different audiences as practicable, and

(8)
Audiovisual content may be received or accessed in accordance with this subsection if—

a penalty imposed by a penalty notice under section 362AZ4(2) or 362BV(2);
(c)
a penalty imposed by a penalty notice under section 362AZ7(6) or 362BY(6).
Amount of penalties: principles
2
(1)
In determining the amount of a penalty to be imposed on a person, OFCOM must, in particular, take into account—
(a)
any representations made, and evidence provided, by the person, and
(b)
the effects of the failure or failures in respect of which the penalty is imposed.
(2)
In the case of a penalty imposed by a confirmation decision, OFCOM must also take into account any representations made, and evidence provided, by any other person to whom the provisional notice of contravention relating to the same matter was given.
(3)
OFCOM must also take into account—
(a)
in the case of a penalty imposed by a confirmation decision, any steps taken by the person towards—
(i)
complying with the duty or duties specified in the provisional notice of contravention given to the person, or
(ii)
remedying the failure to comply with that duty or those duties;
(b)
in the case of a penalty imposed by a penalty notice, any steps taken by the person towards—
(i)
complying with the duty or duties specified in the confirmation decision given to the person, or
(ii)
remedying the failure to comply with that duty or those duties.
(4)
A penalty must be of an amount that OFCOM consider to be—
(a)
appropriate, and
(b)
proportionate to the failure or failures in respect of which it is imposed.
(5)
See also section 392 (which requires OFCOM to produce guidelines about their determination of penalties that they impose).

(a)
a penalty is imposed on a person in respect of a regulated television selection service that is or was at any time provided by that person,

(a)
£250,000, and
(b)
5% of the person’s qualifying worldwide revenue for the person’s most recent complete accounting period.
(3)
In any case other than that described in sub-paragraph (1), the maximum amount of the penalty that may be imposed is £250,000.
(4)
If (in a case described in sub-paragraph (1)) the first accounting period of the person has not yet ended, sub-paragraph (2)(b) is to be read as referring to 5% of the amount that OFCOM estimate to be the person’s likely qualifying worldwide revenue for that period.
(5)
If the duration of the accounting period by reference to which an amount of qualifying worldwide revenue is calculated is less than a year, the amount mentioned in sub-paragraph (2)(b) is to be increased proportionately.
(6)
If the duration of the accounting period by reference to which an amount of qualifying worldwide revenue is calculated is more than a year, the amount mentioned in sub-paragraph (2)(b) is to be decreased proportionately.

The amount of a person’s qualifying worldwide revenue for an accounting period is, in the event of a disagreement between the person and OFCOM, the amount determined by OFCOM.

Maximum amount of penalties: group of entities

(1)
This paragraph contains modifications of paragraph 3 where, in accordance with Schedule 16B, two or more entities are jointly and severally liable for a penalty.

the entity to which the confirmation decision or the penalty notice relates (“entity E”), and
(ii)
every other entity which (at the time the confirmation decision or the penalty notice is given) is a group undertaking in relation to entity E.
(4)
In any case other than that described in sub-paragraph (3), the maximum amount of the penalty for which the entities are liable is £250,000.
(5)
In sub-paragraph (3)(b), the reference to the qualifying worldwide revenue of a group of entities is to—
(a)
the amount of the group’s qualifying worldwide revenue for the most recent complete accounting period of the entities liable for the penalty, or
(b)
if the first accounting period of the entities liable for the penalty has not yet ended, the amount that OFCOM estimate to be the group’s likely qualifying worldwide revenue for that period.
(6)
In a case where the accounting periods of the entities liable for the penalty are different—
(a)
the reference in sub-paragraph (5)(a) to the accounting period of the entities is to be read as a reference to the accounting period of any of the entities (at OFCOM’s discretion), and
(b)
sub-paragraph (5)(b) is to apply as if—
(i)
for “the first accounting period of the entities” there were substituted “the first accounting period of all the entities”, and

are to be read with any necessary modifications if applied to an entity formed under the law of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom.
