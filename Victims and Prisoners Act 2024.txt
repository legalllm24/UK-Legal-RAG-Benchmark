In Part 2 of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 (prevention, investigation and prosecution of crime), after Chapter 3 insert—
“Chapter 3A

a parent or guardian of V or, if V is in the care of a relevant authority or voluntary organisation, a person representing that authority or organisation, or
(b)
if no person described in paragraph (a) is available, any adult who the authorised person considers appropriate.
(5)
The authorised person need not give notice under this section, or specify a particular matter when giving notice, if the authorised person considers that doing so―
(a)
is not reasonably practicable in the circumstances,
(b)
might interfere with the investigation or enquiry for which the information is sought or any other investigation or enquiry which is being pursued, or is to be pursued, by the authorised person or another authorised person, or

might risk causing serious harm to V or another person.

specifying the reason why the information is sought, and
(c)
specifying how the information will be dealt with once it has been obtained.

44D
Code of practice
(1)
The Secretary of State must prepare a code of practice for authorised persons about victim information requests and compliance with this Chapter.
(2)
The code must in particular—
(a)
provide that an authorised person must, when considering whether they are satisfied as required by paragraph (c) of section 44A(3) in relation to a counselling information request, start from the presumption that the request is not necessary and proportionate to achieve a purpose in that paragraph, and
(b)
set out the steps that must be taken by an authorised person when deciding whether that presumption is rebutted.
(3)
For the purposes of subsection (2), a “counselling information request” has the meaning given by section 44A(5).

A statutory instrument containing regulations under subsection (7) is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.
(9)
After the code has come into force the Secretary of State may from time to time revise it.
(10)
A failure on the part of an authorised person to act in accordance with the code does not of itself render the person liable to any criminal or civil proceedings.
(11)
But the code is admissible in evidence in criminal or civil proceedings and a court may take into account a failure to act in accordance with it in determining a question in the proceedings.
(12)
References in subsections (2) to (11) to the code include a revised code, subject to subsection (13).
(13)
The duty to consult in subsection (5) does not apply in relation to the preparation of a revised code if the Secretary of State considers that the proposed revisions are insubstantial.

(g)
any submissions made by or on behalf of the prisoner or the Secretary of State (whether or not on a matter mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (f)).
(6)
When making a public protection decision about a prisoner, the decision-maker must in particular have regard to the protection of any victim of the prisoner.
(7)

(a)
in subsection (1), in the words before paragraph (a), after “life prisoner” insert “under section 28(6)(b), for the purposes of section 28(5),”;
