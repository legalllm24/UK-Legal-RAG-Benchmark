Unitedkingdom,"An employee in England is currently on maternity leave under the Employment Rights Act 1996. During her leave, her employer announces a redundancy process due to company restructuring. Additionally, there are health and safety concerns at the workplace that might affect her return. Considering the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (as amended), the Equality Act 2010, the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, and relevant case law, what protections does she have during redundancy, and how should the employer proceed?","Under the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999, specifically Regulation 10, if an employee on maternity leave is at risk of redundancy, she must be offered any suitable alternative vacancy available before it is offered to other employees, giving her priority for redeployment opportunities. The Equality Act 2010, particularly Section 18, prohibits discrimination because of pregnancy or maternity, requiring employers to ensure that redundancy selection criteria do not disadvantage employees on maternity leave to avoid unlawful discrimination claims. Regarding health and safety, the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, Regulation 16, mandates employers to perform a specific risk assessment for new or expectant mothers, and if risks are identified and cannot be avoided, the employer must adjust her working conditions or hours, offer suitable alternative work on no less favorable terms, or if no alternative is available, suspend her on full pay. Relevant case law, such as Sefton Borough Council v Wainwright [2014] EWCA Civ 953, confirms the obligation to offer suitable alternative employment to employees on maternity leave before others. Therefore, the employer must conduct a fair and non-discriminatory redundancy process, prioritize the employee for any suitable alternative positions, and address health and safety concerns by performing risk assessments and taking necessary actions to protect the employee.","During her maternity leave under the Employment Rights Act 1996, the employee is entitled to various protections. Given the redundancy process announced by her employer and health and safety concerns at the workplace, here's a breakdown of the relevant laws and regulations that apply:

1. **Maternity Leave**: The Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (as amended) provide protection for employees on maternity leave. During this period, employers are prohibited from taking disciplinary action against employees, dismissing them, or making them redundant without their consent.
2. **Equality Act 2010**: This act prohibits discrimination based on pregnancy, maternity, and related conditions. Employers must ensure that policies and practices affecting pregnant employees do not discriminate against them. In this case, the redundancy process might be seen as discriminatory if it disproportionately affects pregnant employees or those on maternity leave.
3. **Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999**: These regulations require employers to maintain a healthy and safe working environment. If there are health and safety concerns that could affect the employee's return to work, the employer must take reasonable steps to mitigate these risks.

Considering these laws, here's how the employer should proceed:

1. **Wait until the maternity leave period ends**: The employer should wait for the employee to finish her maternity leave before considering any redundancies.
2. **Involve HR and legal advisors**: Ensure that HR and legal advisors are consulted throughout the redundancy process to minimize potential disputes and ensure compliance with relevant laws.
3. **Conduct a fair and transparent redundancy process**: Implement a fair and transparent redundancy process, considering all employees equally, without discrimination based on pregnancy or maternity leave.
4. **Provide support for pregnant employees**: Offer support to pregnant employees who may be affected by the redundancy process, such as job sharing or temporary reassignment of tasks.
5. **Address health and safety concerns**: Implement measures to address health and safety concerns at the workplace, ensuring a safe working environment for all employees.

In terms of specific protections, the employee has:

1. **Protection from dismissal during maternity leave**: The Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 prohibit employers from dismissing pregnant employees without their consent.
2. **Protection from discriminatory treatment**: The Equality Act 2010 prohibits employers from treating pregnant employees or those on maternity leave unfairly or less favorably than other employees.
3. **Right to request flexible working arrangements**: The employee may be entitled to request flexible working arrangements upon her return to work, subject to business needs and company policies.

Ultimately, the employer should prioritize fair treatment, transparency, and compliance with relevant laws to minimize potential disputes and ensure a positive experience for all employees.","['', ' Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999, Regulation 10\r\n', ' Equality Act 2010, Section 18\r\n', ' Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, Regulation 16']",11,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999/3312), the Paternity and Adoption Leave Regulations 2002 (S.I. 2002/2788) and the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/3050). They also amend the Paternity and Adoption Leave (Adoption from Overseas) Regulations 2003 (S.I. 2003/921) and the Shared Parental Leave and Paternity and Adoption Leave (Adoptions from Overseas) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/3092) to ensure equivalent provision for those adopting children from overseas.
The amendments extend existing requirements that apply to employers when redundancy situations arise where an employee is on maternity, adoption or shared parental leave, so that those requirements can also apply during pregnancy and for a period of time after that leave has ended. For those taking shared parental leave who have not taken maternity or adoption leave, there is a six-week threshold of continuous leave that needs to be met for the requirements to apply for a period of time after shared parental leave has ended. Where the six-week threshold is not met, the requirements apply during shared parental leave.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

Unitedkingdom,"A tenant in England reports a malfunctioning carbon monoxide alarm installed under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (Amendment) Regulations 2022. Despite notifying the landlord, the alarm has not been repaired or replaced after three weeks. The tenant is concerned about safety and compliance. Under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm Regulations 2015 (as amended), what are the landlord's legal obligations, and what actions can the tenant take?","Under Regulation 6 of the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015, when a landlord is served with a remedial notice for breaching one or more duties outlined in Regulation 4(1) (such as failing to install or maintain smoke or carbon monoxide alarms), the landlord must take the specified remedial actions within the timeframe set out in Regulation 5(2)(d), typically 28 days from the notice's issuance. This regulation imposes a clear duty on the landlord to address the breach promptly and ensures tenant safety through enforcement mechanisms. However, Regulation 6(2) provides that a landlord will not be considered in breach of this obligation if they can demonstrate that they have taken all reasonable steps, short of initiating legal proceedings, to comply with the duty. Reasonable steps may include hiring contractors, arranging access to the property, or documenting efforts to resolve tenant-related barriers to compliance. Proper evidence of these steps is crucial to establish the landlord’s diligence. This provision ensures that while landlords are held accountable, genuine efforts to comply are recognized, even if the issue remains unresolved due to circumstances beyond their control.","Under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (Amendment) Regulations 2022, the landlord is required to repair or replace the malfunctioning carbon monoxide alarm within a reasonable timeframe. However, since it has been three weeks and the issue remains unresolved, the tenant's concerns about safety and compliance are valid.

The correct answer would be:

The landlord's legal obligation is not explicitly stated in the provided text. According to Section 13(f) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, which is being repealed by the amendment, landlords had a repairing standard duty to ensure fire and carbon monoxide detection equipment was installed, maintained, and properly functioning.

However, under the amended regulations, it is not explicitly stated what the landlord's legal obligations are for a malfunctioning carbon monoxide alarm. The tenant should notify their local authorities or housing agency for assistance with reporting the issue.

The tenant can take actions such as:

1.  Notifying the landlord again and requesting that they repair or replace the carbon monoxide alarm within a reasonable timeframe.
2.  Contacting their local authorities or housing agency to report the issue and request assistance in resolving it.
3.  Checking their tenancy agreement for any specific requirements or responsibilities related to maintaining the carbon monoxide alarm.
4.  Seeking advice from a tenant's rights organization or a lawyer specializing in housing law.

The tenant can also take steps to ensure their safety, such as:

1.  Installing a working carbon monoxide alarm on an open plan living area and in circulation spaces.
2.  Keeping a log of the issue and any communication with the landlord regarding repairs or replacements.
3.  Seeking assistance from a local tenants' rights organization or a housing agency if they are concerned about their safety.

Unitedkingdom,"Residents in an English town are concerned that their local authority has not implemented separate food waste collections, as required by the Environment Act 2021. The deadline has passed, and there is no plan in place. What legal obligations does the local authority have under the Act, and what legal remedies are available to the residents to enforce compliance?","Under the Environment Act 2021, specifically Section 57, which inserts Section 45AZB into the Environmental Protection Act 1990, local authorities in England are legally obligated to arrange for the separate collection of food waste from households; failure to do so constitutes a breach of statutory duty. Residents can raise the issue with the local authority by submitting formal complaints requesting compliance, engage with local councillors and Members of Parliament (MPs) to advocate for action, and may have standing to apply for a judicial review of the local authority's failure to comply with statutory duties, as established in cases like R (on the application of Greenpeace Ltd) v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1998] Env LR 415; they must act promptly and within three months of the grounds arising.","The Environment Act 2021 requires local authorities in England to implement separate food waste collections by December 2023. The local authority's obligation is to provide this service as part of its waste management plans.

Under the Act, local authorities have a duty to:

1. Prepare and submit a waste plan: By December 2022, the local authority must prepare a waste plan that includes a strategy for managing food waste, among other waste streams.
2. Implement separate food waste collections: By December 2023, the local authority must implement separate food waste collections as part of its waste management services.

If the residents in the English town are concerned about the lack of separate food waste collections and there is no plan in place, they can take the following legal remedies to enforce compliance:

1. **Request for Information**: The residents can request information from the local authority regarding their waste management plans and policies. This can help them understand the authority's position on this issue.
2. **Freedom of Information Request**: Residents can make a Freedom of Information (FOI) request to obtain specific information about the authority's implementation of separate food waste collections, including any deadlines or milestones.
3. **Complaint to the local authority**: Residents can complain to the local authority about their non-compliance with the Act. The authority should respond promptly and provide a timeline for implementing the required service.
4. **Involve the Environmental Agency (EA)**: If the residents are not satisfied with the local authority's response, they can involve the EA, which is responsible for enforcing environmental regulations in England.
5. **Consider judicial review**: Residents may be able to challenge the non-compliance through a judicial review process if it is deemed that the decision was made in breach of relevant laws or regulations.

It's essential for residents to document their concerns and interactions with the local authority, as this will help build a paper trail and demonstrate the lack of action taken by the authority.","['', ' Environment Act 2021, Section 57 (inserting Section 45AZB into the Environmental Protection Act 1990)\r\n', ' Environmental Protection Act 1990, Section 45AZB (as inserted by the Environment Act 2021)']",11,True,"Prospective

The Regulations specify the standard to be achieved in respect of the target and the date by which it must be achieved.
Regulation 2 makes provision in respect of a long-term target to ensure that the total mass of residual waste per head of population in England does not exceed 287 kilograms by 31st December 2042. Regulation 3 makes provision in relation to how the target is to be measured. Regulation 4 provides that the reporting date for the target is 31st January 2044. Regulation 5 makes provision for, amongst other things, a definition of “excluded waste”. Schedule 1 makes further provision in relation to the definition of “excluded waste”.
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is available from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 2 Marsham Street, London SW1P 4DF, and is published with an Explanatory Memorandum alongside these Regulations on www.legislation.gov.uk.","{'category': 'Exclusively or primarily applies to UK', 'country': 'UnitedKingdom', 'file': 'The Environmental Targets (Residual Waste) (England) Regulations 2022.txt', 'legislation': 'UK Draft Statutory Instruments', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2022/9780348242973/note', 'year': '2022'}","STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS

Wales,"An employee lives in Wales but works in England. They are planning to take Shared Parental Leave (SPL) following the birth of their child. They are unsure how the differences between Welsh and English regulations might affect their entitlement and whether their residence in Wales impacts their rights. Under the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, what are their rights, and does their place of residence affect their entitlement? ","Under the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, which are authorized by the Employment Rights Act 1996, an employee's entitlement to Shared Parental Leave (SPL) is determined by their employment status and specific eligibility criteria, irrespective of their place of residence. The regulations apply uniformly across England and Wales. To qualify for SPL, the employee must have been continuously employed by the same employer for at least 26 weeks by the end of the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth and remain employed at the start of each period of SPL taken. Additionally, their partner must have worked (employed or self-employed) for at least 26 of the 66 weeks before the expected week of childbirth and have earned an average of at least £30 per week in 13 of those weeks. These criteria are outlined in the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, specifically in Part 2, Chapter 1, Regulation 6. Therefore, an employee residing in Wales and working in England is entitled to SPL, provided they meet these eligibility requirements, with their place of residence having no impact on their entitlement.","The employee's right to Shared Parental Leave (SPL) under the Shared Parental Leave and Paternity and Adoption Leave (Adoptions from Overseas) Regulations 2014 is governed by English law. Although the employee lives in Wales, they are entitled to SPL as if they were working in England.

Regulation 39 of the Shared Parental Leave and Paternity and Adoption Leave (Adoptions from Overseas) Regulations 2014 states that an eligible employee must be ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom on the relevant day. The regulations do not specify a minimum or maximum period of residence, nor does it distinguish between Welsh and English residents.

However, when making a claim for SPL, the employee will need to meet certain conditions, including having qualifying weeks of service with the employer before the child is born. The regulations also require that the employee is employed by an eligible employer and meets other eligibility criteria, such as being employed on average fewer than 36 weeks per year over the past 2 years.

The employee's place of residence in Wales does not affect their entitlement to SPL, but it may impact their tax and benefits situation. As a resident of Wales, they would be subject to Welsh tax laws and benefit payments, which may differ from those available in England.

It is essential for the employee to consult with HR or an employment law expert to ensure they understand their eligibility for SPL and how their residence in Wales affects their entitlement to this leave. They should also review their employment contract, company policies, and relevant regulations to determine the specifics of their situation.","['', ' Employment Rights Act 1996:\r\n', ' Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014']",11,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999/3312), the Paternity and Adoption Leave Regulations 2002 (S.I. 2002/2788) and the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/3050). They also amend the Paternity and Adoption Leave (Adoption from Overseas) Regulations 2003 (S.I. 2003/921) and the Shared Parental Leave and Paternity and Adoption Leave (Adoptions from Overseas) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/3092) to ensure equivalent provision for those adopting children from overseas.
The amendments extend existing requirements that apply to employers when redundancy situations arise where an employee is on maternity, adoption or shared parental leave, so that those requirements can also apply during pregnancy and for a period of time after that leave has ended. For those taking shared parental leave who have not taken maternity or adoption leave, there is a six-week threshold of continuous leave that needs to be met for the requirements to apply for a period of time after shared parental leave has ended. Where the six-week threshold is not met, the requirements apply during shared parental leave.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. A full impact assessment has been prepared in relation to the Protection from Redundancy (Pregnancy and Family Leave) Act 2023 and to which this instrument gives effect, and a copy is available at https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3191/publications.","{'category': 'May contain legislation that applies to Wales', 'country': 'Wales', 'file': 'The Maternity Leave, Adoption Leave and Shared Parental Leave (Amendment) Regulations 2024.txt', 'legislation': 'UK Statutory Instruments', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2024/264/note/made', 'year': '2024'}","Restriction on travelling into Wales

Wales,"A tenant in Wales is experiencing severe damp and mold in their rented property, which the landlord has failed to address despite repeated requests. Under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, what are the landlord's obligations regarding repairs and safety, and what actions can the tenant take to enforce these obligations?","Under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, landlords are obligated to maintain rental properties in a condition fit for human habitation. Specifically, Section 91 mandates that landlords must ensure the dwelling is fit for human habitation both at the start and throughout the duration of the tenancy. Section 92 requires landlords to keep in repair the structure and exterior of the dwelling, including drains, gutters, and external pipes, and to maintain installations for the supply of water, gas, electricity, sanitation, space heating, and heating water. If a landlord fails to address severe damp and mold despite repeated requests, the tenant should notify the landlord in writing, keeping records of all communications. If the landlord remains unresponsive, the tenant can contact the local authority's Environmental Health department, which can inspect the property and issue improvement notices. Additionally, the tenant may apply to the court for an order requiring the landlord to carry out repairs. It's advisable to seek legal advice before considering actions like withholding rent or arranging for repairs independently, as these carry legal risks.","Under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, the landlord has a duty of care to ensure that the rental property is fit for human habitation. In this case, the severe damp and mold in the rented property pose a risk to the tenant's health and safety.

The landlord's obligations regarding repairs and safety are as follows:

1. **Repairing the property**: The landlord must take reasonable steps to repair or remediate any defects that render the property unfit for human habitation, including addressing the issue of damp and mold.
2. **Providing a safe environment**: The landlord must ensure that the property is a safe place to live, free from hazards such as water damage, poor ventilation, or structural issues.

The tenant can take the following actions to enforce these obligations:

1. **Notify the landlord in writing**: The tenant should inform the landlord of the issue and provide written notice outlining the defects and their potential impact on health and safety.
2. **Request a response within 14 days**: The tenant should request a response from the landlord, specifying what steps they will take to address the issues.
3. **Seek assistance from a mediation service**: If the landlord fails to respond or takes insufficient action, the tenant can seek assistance from a mediation service, such as the Dispute Resolution Service (DRS) Wales.
4. **Contact a local authority**: If the issue remains unresolved, the tenant can contact the local authority's housing department for support and guidance.
5. **Consider court action**: If all else fails, the tenant may need to take the landlord to court to seek an order requiring the necessary repairs or compensation.

Additionally, the tenant should also be aware of their rights under other relevant laws, such as the Equality Act 2010 (which protects against harassment and intimidation) and the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (which requires landlords to ensure a safe working environment).

It's essential for tenants in Wales to familiarize themselves with their rights and responsibilities regarding repairs and safety under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, as well as other relevant laws and regulations.","['', "" Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, Section 91: Landlord's obligation: fitness for human habitation\r\n"", "" Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, Section 92: Landlord's obligation to keep dwelling in repair""]",11,True,"Repairs

Wales,"A retailer in Wales is found selling alcohol below the minimum unit price set by the Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018. They argue that discounts and promotions allow them to reduce prices. What does the Act stipulate regarding minimum alcohol pricing, and what penalties could the retailer face for non-compliance?","Under the Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018, it is an offence for alcohol retailers in Wales to sell alcohol below the applicable minimum price, regardless of discounts or promotions. The Act defines the minimum price using the formula M × S × V, where M is the minimum unit price (set at 50p), S is the percentage strength of the alcohol, and V is the volume in litres. Non-compliance can result in enforcement actions by local authorities, including the issuance of fixed penalty notices of £200 for each offence. Therefore, retailers must adhere to the minimum pricing regulations, as discounts and promotions do not permit selling alcohol below the established minimum price.","The Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018 sets a minimum unit price for alcohol in Wales, which is the price per unit of alcohol. The Act stipulates that:

* A local authority must set a minimum unit price for alcohol for licensed premises.
* The minimum unit price must be at least £0.50 for spirits and other alcoholic beverages (excluding beer).
* The retailer cannot offer any promotion or discount that reduces the price of alcohol below the minimum unit price.

If a retailer in Wales is found selling alcohol below the minimum unit price set by the Act, they could face penalties, including:

* A fine of up to £5,000 for each day of non-compliance.
* A court order requiring them to pay an amount equivalent to the shortfall in revenue due to the sale of alcohol at a lower price than allowed by law.
* The retailer may also be required to pay back any profits made from selling alcohol below the minimum unit price.

It's worth noting that the Act also provides for exemptions and dispensations, such as for certain licensed premises or for the sale of special types of drink. However, in general, retailers who fail to comply with the minimum unit price requirement may face significant fines and penalties.","['', ' Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018']",11,True,"WELSH STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS

Wales,"A homeowner in Wales wants to build a large extension to their property without applying for planning permission, arguing that it's within permitted development rights. Under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Wales) Order 1995 and recent amendments, what are the rules regarding extensions, and when is planning permission required?","Under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Wales) Order 1995, as amended, specific conditions allow certain extensions to be built without a formal planning application, known as permitted development rights. Below are the key provisions relevant to the homeowner’s question:\nRelevant Provisions for Extensions:\nVolume Limitations:\n                        * Terraced Houses or Properties on Article 1(5) Land: The cumulative volume of the extension must not exceed the volume of the original dwellinghouse by more than 50 cubic meters or 10% (whichever is greater).\n                        * Other Houses: The cumulative volume must not exceed 70 cubic meters or 15% (whichever is greater).\n                        * Absolute Limit: In all cases, the increase must not exceed 115 cubic meters.\nHeight Restrictions:\n                        * The height of the extension must not exceed the highest part of the existing roof.\n                        * For properties with a flat roof, the extension must not be taller than the height of the original dwellinghouse.\nProximity to Boundaries:\n                        * No part of the extension should be nearer to any highway than the nearest part of the original dwellinghouse unless the extension is at least 20 meters from the highway.\nDesignated Areas:\n                        * Properties in designated areas such as conservation areas, National Parks, or Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty have more restricted permitted development rights, potentially requiring formal planning permission even for smaller extensions.\nImportant Considerations:\n                        * Amendments: The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (Wales) Orders 2014 and 2019 introduce specific changes and clarifications but do not fundamentally alter the provisions related to standard extensions under Schedule 2, Part 1. The 2014 amendment refines some criteria for residential projects, while the 2019 amendment includes updates relevant to designated areas and certain types of land use.\n                        * Verification with Authorities: Due to potential nuances or recent legislative changes that could affect individual cases, consulting the local planning authority or a professional planner is crucial to confirm compliance with current regulations.","Under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Wales) Order 1995 and recent amendments, extensions to a property in Wales fall under permitted development rights. However, there are specific rules and conditions that apply.

To determine if planning permission is required for an extension, the homeowner should consider the following:

1. **Size and scale**: The size of the extension relative to the existing property must be considered. Extensions that exceed certain thresholds (e.g., 4 meters in height or 75 square meters in area) may require planning permission.
2. **Location**: The location of the extension is crucial. If it's located within a World Heritage Site, special rules apply, and the homeowner should not rely on class B of Part 9 (development relating to roads) of Schedule 2 (permitted development rights).
3. **Planning authority approval**: Even if the extension falls under permitted development rights, the planning authority may still approve it or refuse it. The homeowner must comply with any conditions imposed by the planning authority.
4. **Special considerations**: If the extension requires significant changes to the property's appearance, access, or amenities, it may be subject to special considerations.

To avoid potential issues, homeowners in Wales can consult with their local planning authority to determine if planning permission is required for their proposed extension. It's always better to err on the side of caution and apply for planning permission if there are any doubts about the rules and regulations.

Recent amendments, such as those related to section 136 of the Historic Environment (Wales) Act 2023, which allows planning authorities to acquire buildings by agreement, may also impact the decision-making process. However, this is not directly related to the rules regarding extensions under permitted development rights.

In summary, while some extensions in Wales fall under permitted development rights, there are specific rules and conditions that apply, and homeowners should consult with their local planning authority to determine if planning permission is required for their proposed extension.","['', ' The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, Schedule 2, Part 1\r\n', ' The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (Wales) Order 2014\r\n', ' The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (Wales) Order 2019']",11,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Wales,"A parent in Wales is seeking additional learning support for their child, who has been diagnosed with special educational needs (SEN). How does the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 protect the child’s right to education, and what steps should the parent take to ensure their child receives the necessary support?","The Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 provides a strong legal framework to protect the rights of children with special educational needs (SEN) in Wales, ensuring they receive appropriate education and support. Here's how the Act safeguards these rights and the steps parents should take:\nHow the Act Protects the Child’s Right to Education\n                           * Definition of Additional Learning Needs (ALN) (Section 2): The Act defines ALN as a learning difficulty or disability that requires additional learning provision. This ensures children who face significantly greater learning challenges than their peers or have disabilities affecting their use of educational facilities are identified and supported.\n                           * Individual Development Plans (IDPs) (Section 10): The Act mandates the creation of IDPs for children with ALN. These comprehensive, tailored plans detail the specific support required and are maintained by local authorities or educational institutions, guaranteeing that each child's unique needs are met.\n                           * Duties of Local Authorities and Schools (Sections 11 and 14): Local authorities and the governing bodies of maintained schools have a duty to identify children with ALN and make appropriate provisions.

Although the Act does not explicitly state this in Section 11, it mandates that authorities and schools must decide if a child has ALN when concerns are raised.\n                           * Engage in the IDP Process: Actively participate in the development and review of the IDP. Ensure the IDP reflects the child's current needs and advocate for revisions as needed.\n                           * Utilize Available Resources: Make use of the information and advice provided by local authorities as mandated in Section 9. This will help parents understand their rights and the provisions their child is entitled to.\n                           * Address Disagreements: If there are concerns about the IDP or the support provided, use the dispute resolution mechanisms outlined in Section 68. For unresolved issues, parents can appeal to the Education Tribunal for Wales as outlined in Section 70.\n                           * Regularly Review the IDP: Ensure that the IDP is reviewed regularly, as mandated by the Act, to keep it aligned with the child’s evolving educational needs.\nThis framework ensures that children with SEN in Wales receive the educational support they require, and parents are empowered to advocate effectively for their child’s rights.","The Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 provides a statutory framework for supporting children and young people with additional learning needs in Wales. This Act replaces the legislation surrounding special educational needs and the assessment of children and young people with learning difficulties.

To protect the child's right to education, the Act ensures that:

1. **Individualized Education Plans**: The Act requires local authorities to prepare an individual education plan for each child with additional learning needs, outlining specific support requirements. This ensures that the child receives tailored support to meet their needs.
2. **Education Provision**: The Act obliges local authorities to provide adequate education provision for children with additional learning needs, including access to specialist resources and teaching staff.
3. **Dispute Resolution**: The Act establishes the Education Tribunal (Wales), which provides a mechanism for resolving disputes between parents and local authorities regarding additional learning needs.

To ensure their child receives the necessary support, parents should:

1. **Work with the Local Authority**: Engage with the local authority to discuss their child's needs and develop an individual education plan.
2. **Seek Advice**: Consult with the Education Welfare Officer or a specialist educational advisor to understand their rights and entitlements under the Act.
3. **Attend the Education Tribunal**: If necessary, attend a hearing before the Education Tribunal to dispute any decisions made by the local authority regarding additional learning needs.
4. **Advocate for Their Child's Rights**: Ensure that the child's rights are represented in all discussions and decision-making processes related to their additional learning needs.

By following these steps, parents can advocate effectively on behalf of their child, ensuring they receive the necessary support to access education and reach their full potential.","['', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 2: Definition of Additional Learning Needs (ALN)\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 6: Participation and Rights\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 9: Access to Information and Advice\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 10: Individual Development Plans (IDPs)\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 11: Duties to Decide: Maintained Schools and Further Education Institutions\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 14: Duties of Local Authorities and Schools\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 68: Dispute Resolution Mechanisms\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 70: Appeals to the Education Tribunal for Wales']",11,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Scotland,"An employee in Scotland has recently lost a child and is unsure of their entitlement to bereavement leave. Under the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018, what are their rights, and what obligations does the employer have?","Under the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018, incorporated into the Employment Rights Act 1996 and the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, employees in Scotland who have lost a child are entitled to specific rights, and employers have corresponding obligations. Section 80EA of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (as amended) grants eligible employees the right to take at least two weeks of parental bereavement leave. This leave must be taken within 56 days from the date of the child’s death and applies to the death of a child under 18. Section 80EE extends these rights to cases involving stillbirths after 24 weeks of pregnancy. Employers are obligated to provide this leave, ensuring that eligible employees can take time off without facing any detriment or dismissal related to their leave request. For statutory parental bereavement pay, Section 171ZZ6 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (as amended) outlines the entitlement, specifying that the employee must meet certain conditions such as a continuous employment period of at least 26 weeks ending with the ""relevant week"" (the week immediately before the child’s death) and minimum earnings meeting the lower earnings limit. Section 171ZZ7 adds that employees must give notice to their employer about the weeks for which they seek parental bereavement pay, and employers may require this notice in writing. Regulations under this section may also stipulate further requirements, such as providing evidence of entitlement or conditions for determining continuous employment. In addition to these primary sections, reviewing supporting regulations linked to the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018 and related guidance is essential for comprehensive compliance. Regulations detail how leave is to be taken, how statutory pay is processed, and additional procedural requirements for both employees and employers.","Under the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018, an employee in Scotland who has lost a child is entitled to bereavement leave. The exact terms of their entitlement will depend on the specific circumstances of their employment and the provisions of the Act.

In general, the employee is likely to be entitled to:

* A minimum of two weeks' paid bereavement leave following the death of their child
* A payment equivalent to their normal weekly pay for up to a maximum period of 52 weeks

However, the Act also provides for special provision in cases where both the child and the mother die (section 80A) or where a person with whom the child is placed or expected to be placed for adoption dies (section 80B). In these cases, the regulations may provide that an employee who satisfies the conditions is entitled to leave under these sections despite the fact that the leave cannot be taken for that purpose.

In terms of obligations, the employer has a duty to:

* Provide the employee with bereavement leave, subject to any qualifying period of employment
* Pay the employee their normal weekly pay during the bereavement leave period
* Ensure that the employee's rights under the Act are not affected by the fact that they have worked in an EEA state in the 26 weeks preceding the death of the child (section 7)

It is worth noting that the Paternity Leave (Bereavement) Act 2024 also provides for additional provisions, such as the ability of bereaved employees to work for their employer during a period of leave under section 80A or 80B without bringing the particular period of leave or the employee's entitlement to leave to an end. However, this is a separate provision from the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018.

It would be best for the employee to consult with their HR representative or employment lawyer to confirm their specific entitlements and obligations under the Act.","['', ' 1.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations introduce a new statutory entitlement for bereaved parents who are employees to take up to two weeks’ leave from their job called parental bereavement leave in the 56 weeks following the death of a child. These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers inserted into the Employment Rights Act 1996 (c. 18) (the “1996 Act”) by the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay Act) 2018 (c. 24).
Part 2 relates to entitlement to parental bereavement leave. The right to take parental bereavement leave is conferred by regulation 4 which sets out the conditions for entitlement which must be satisfied by the employee in order to take parental bereavement leave. These include substantive requirements, such as the employee falling within the definition of a bereaved parent (in particular, specifying the types of parental relationships in respect of which the new entitlement arises), as well as procedural requirements, such as the employee giving appropriate notices to their employer. Where an employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave under regulation 4 as the result of the death of more than one child, the employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave in respect of each child.
Regulation 5 sets out the number of weeks of parental bereavement leave that are available to a bereaved parent and gives an employee the option of taking either one or two weeks’ parental bereavement leave. The weeks taken as parental bereavement leave do not need to be taken consecutively. It also provides that parental bereavement leave may only be taken within the period of 56 weeks beginning with the date of the child’s death.
Regulation 6 details the notice requirements and other information the bereaved parent must provide to their employer before taking parental bereavement leave. An employee does not need to provide notice in writing to his or her employer, but the length of notice required to book and cancel parental bereavement leave will vary depending on whether the period the employee intends to take as parental bereavement leave falls within 56 days of the child’s death or later. Regulations 7 and 8 respectively set out when an employee’s period of bereavement leave may start and what happens when a period of parental bereavement leave is interrupted by another type of statutory leave under Part 8 of the 1996 Act.
Part 3 contains provisions applicable in relation to the taking of parental bereavement leave. Regulation 9 elaborates on the new section 80EB of the 1996 Act, by providing that an employee is entitled during his or her absence on leave to the benefit of all of his or her terms and conditions of employment apart from the right to remuneration (excluded by Section 80EB(3)(b)); also that the employee is subject to all of the obligations under those terms and conditions except in so far as they are inconsistent with the right to take parental bereavement leave (the exception appears in section 80EB(1)(b)). Regulations 10 and 11 provide for an employee’s right to return to work after taking a period of parental bereavement leave, distinguishing the case where the leave was an isolated period of absence from the case where it followed another period of statutory leave. Regulations 12 and 13 provide that an employee entitled to parental bereavement leave is protected from detriment and dismissal attributable to the fact that they took or sought to take parental bereavement leave.
Part 4 contains provisions applicable where an employee has a contractual right to parental bereavement leave, in addition to the statutory right contained within these Regulations.
These Regulations are part of a package of legislative measures and the relevant impact assessment is the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill impact assessment which was published on 14 May 2018.

Scotland,"A tenant in Scotland has reported significant dampness and mold in their rented flat to the landlord, who has not taken any action. Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, what are the landlord's obligations, and what steps can the tenant take to enforce these obligations?","Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, landlords are required to ensure that their rental properties meet the Repairing Standard, as defined in Section 13 of the Act. This includes ensuring that the property is wind and watertight, reasonably fit for human habitation, and that the structure and exterior are in a reasonable state of repair. Additionally, installations for the supply of water, gas, electricity, sanitation, heating, and hot water must be kept in proper working order. Significant dampness and mold indicate a failure to meet this standard. Under Section 14, landlords have a duty to ensure that the house meets the repairing standard at the start of the tenancy and throughout its duration. This duty requires landlords to complete any necessary repairs within a reasonable time after being notified by the tenant or otherwise becoming aware of the need for repairs. Failure to act within a reasonable timeframe constitutes a breach of this duty. If the landlord does not take action, the tenant can apply to the First-tier Tribunal under Section 22 of the Act. This section allows tenants to seek a decision from the Tribunal if the property does not meet the Repairing Standard. The Tribunal can investigate and issue a Repairing Standard Enforcement Order (RSEO) under Section 24, compelling the landlord to carry out the required repairs within a specified timeframe. If the landlord fails to comply with the RSEO, under Section 26, the Tribunal must notify the local authority and may consider imposing a rent relief order to reduce the tenant’s rent. The Tribunal may excuse non-compliance if the landlord demonstrates an inability to comply due to a lack of necessary rights (e.g., access) or if the required work poses a danger to any person. In such cases, the Tribunal must notify the local authority of its findings. The Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 provides tenants with clear mechanisms to address substandard housing conditions and enforce their rights against landlords who fail to fulfill their obligations. These regulations govern the procedures of the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland Housing and Property Chamber, which is responsible for handling cases brought under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, including applications related to the Repairing Standard. The regulations ensure that disputes between tenants and landlords are resolved fairly and efficiently. They outline the rules for submitting applications, conducting hearings, issuing decisions, and enforcing orders such as Repairing Standard Enforcement Orders (RSEOs). This procedural framework directly supports tenants in seeking remedies for landlords' failures to meet their legal obligations under the Act.","I don't have information on the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 or its specific provisions related to dampness and mold in rented flats. However, I can provide general guidance on the typical obligations of landlords in Scotland under housing law.

In general, a landlord in Scotland is responsible for maintaining the health, safety, and condensation standards of their rental property. This includes ensuring that the premises are free from significant dampness and mold, which can pose serious health risks to tenants.

If a tenant has reported significant dampness and mold to the landlord, who has not taken any action, the tenant may be able to take the following steps:

1. **Review the tenancy agreement**: The tenant should review their tenancy agreement to understand their rights and obligations regarding maintenance and repairs.
2. **Notify the landlord again**: The tenant should inform the landlord in writing of the ongoing dampness and mold issue, requesting that they take immediate action to address the problem.
3. **Seek assistance from a housing organization**: The tenant may be able to seek assistance from a local housing organization or a housing ombudsman service, which can provide guidance and support in resolving the issue.
4. **Consider seeking a repair notice**: If the landlord has failed to respond to the tenant's concerns, the tenant may be able to apply for a repair notice under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, which requires the landlord to undertake repairs within a specified timeframe.

It is essential to note that specific obligations and procedures may vary depending on the terms of the tenancy agreement, local laws, and regulations. If you are a tenant facing similar issues, I recommend consulting with a housing organization or seeking advice from a lawyer specializing in housing law to understand your rights and options.","['', ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 13: The Repairing Standard\r\n', "" Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 14: Landlord's Duty to Repair and Maintain\r\n"", ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 22: Application to the First', 'tier Tribunal\r\n', ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 24: Repairing Standard Enforcement Order (RSEO)\r\n', ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 26: Effect of Failure to Comply with Repairing Standard Enforcement Order\r\n', ' Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014\r\n', ' First', 'tier Tribunal for Scotland Housing and Property Chamber (Procedure) Regulations 2017 https://www.legislation.gov.Unitedkingdom/ssi/2017/328/contents/made']",11,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations introduce measures to improve the energy efficiency of certain private rented property in Scotland.
The Regulations apply to domestic private rented property. They prescribe a minimum level of energy efficiency by means of the energy performance indicator included on the energy performance certificate for the property. This minimum level is set for the period from 1 October 2020 to 31 March 2022 as an energy efficiency or performance rating of E, and for the period from and after 1 April 2022 as an energy efficiency or performance rating of D. The Regulations provide that, subject to prescribed exceptions, a landlord of a domestic private rented property must not grant a new tenancy of the property after 1 October 2020, and must not continue to let the property after that date, where the energy efficiency or performance rating of the property is below the minimum level.
The Regulations make provision for the enforcement of the requirements of the Regulations by local authorities in relation to domestic private rented properties (“enforcement authority”). Landlords seeking to rely on a prescribed exemption when letting a private rented property which falls below the minimum level of energy efficiency must register that exemption on a register maintained by the local authority for their area. Where an enforcement authority considers that a landlord may be in breach of a requirement of the Regulations, it may serve a compliance notice requiring the landlord to provide evidence to the enforcement authority. Where an enforcement authority is satisfied that a landlord is in breach, it may issue a penalty notice imposing a financial penalty. The landlord may request a review of the penalty notice by the enforcement authority and, where a penalty notice is confirmed on review, may appeal against the imposition of the penalty notice to Sheriff court.","{'category': 'Exclusively or primarily applies to Scotland', 'country': 'Scotland', 'file': 'The Energy Efficiency (Domestic Private Rented Property) (Scotland) Regulations 2020.txt', 'legislation': 'Scottish Draft Statutory Instruments', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/sdsi/2020/9780111043912/note', 'year': '2020'}","Pre-action requirements for private residential tenancies

Scotland,"An individual in Scotland is experiencing domestic abuse from their partner with whom they share a tenancy. They wish to remove the abuser from the home but are unsure of their rights. Under the Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021, what legal protections are available, and what steps should they take?","Individuals experiencing domestic abuse in Scotland can seek protection through several legal mechanisms. Under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, they can apply for a Non-Harassment Order, which prohibits the abuser from engaging in threatening or harassing behavior. Additionally, the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981 allows for an Exclusion Order to remove the abuser from the shared home and prevent them from re-entering. This Act applies not only to married couples but also to cohabitants. The individual should contact the police to report the abuse, as domestic abuse is a criminal offense under the Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2018, which recognizes controlling behavior as abuse. Seeking legal advice from a solicitor experienced in domestic abuse cases is advisable to assist with applications for protective orders, and engaging with support services such as Scottish Women's Aid can provide additional assistance and guidance.","Under the Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021, an individual experiencing domestic abuse from their partner may be entitled to various legal protections. 

Firstly, the abuser's behavior may be considered abusive under Scottish law, which could impact their rights as a joint tenant. According to section 14 of the Act, a person who is the sole tenant or one of the joint tenants has engaged in behaviour that is abusive of another person (in this case, the partner), and meets certain conditions.

If these conditions are met, the individual may be entitled to:

1.  A court order for possession: The individual can apply to the court for a possession order, which would allow them to recover possession of the house from their partner.
2.  An order to terminate joint tenancy: If the individual is a joint tenant with their partner, they may be able to apply to the court to bring their partner's interest in the tenancy to an end.
3.  Protection from abuse: The Act provides protection from abuse under section 3 and 4, which makes it an offense for anyone to commit any act of abuse or make a threat of abuse towards another person in relation to that other person's home.

To take advantage of these protections, the individual should:

1.  Seek advice: They should seek advice from a solicitor specializing in domestic law or a local authority who can provide them with personalized guidance.
2.  Document evidence: They should gather evidence of the abuse, including dates, times, and details of incidents, as well as any communication records (e.g., emails, text messages) between them and their partner.
3.  Apply to court: If they decide to apply for a possession order or an order to terminate joint tenancy, they will need to submit an application to the court, providing all necessary evidence and supporting documentation.
4.  Seek support: They should also seek support from local authorities, such as a domestic abuse shelter or counseling services, which can provide them with emotional and practical assistance during this difficult time.

By taking these steps, the individual can take control of their situation and ensure that they receive the legal protections and support they need to stay safe.","['', ' Protection from Harassment Act 1997\r\n', ' Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981\r\n', ' Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2018']",11,True,"Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision in connection with the redress scheme established by the Redress for Survivors (Historical Child Abuse in Care) (Scotland) Act 2021 (asp 15) (“the Act”).
Section 18 of the Act enables a person to apply for a redress payment if the person or, in the case of an application for a next of kin payment, the person in respect of whom the application is made was abused while a child, and resident in a relevant care setting in Scotland. The abuse (as defined in section 19 of the Act to include sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse and abuse which takes the form of neglect) must have occurred before 1 December 2004. The definition of “relevant care setting” in section 20 of the Act comprises residential institutions such as children’s homes and residential care facilities, as well as other residential placements in consequence of boarding out or fostering arrangements. Section 18 is subject to section 23 of the Act.
Section 23(1) of the Act enables the Scottish Ministers to make regulations providing that an application may not be made under section 18 if the person who carried out the abuse was of a specified description, if the abuse was carried out in circumstances of a specified description, if the person who was abused came to be resident in the relevant care setting concerned in specified circumstances, or if the person who was abused was resident in the relevant care setting concerned for a specified purpose.
These Regulations make provision under section 23 of the Act for the purpose of creating exceptions to eligibility to apply for a redress payment under section 18 of the Act.
Regulation 2 makes provision for an exception where a person was placed in a relevant care setting for the purpose of being provided with short-term respite or holiday under arrangements made between a parent or guardian of that person and another person.
Impact assessments have been prepared in relation to the Act and instruments under it and will be published online at www.gov.scot.","{'category': 'Exclusively or primarily applies to Scotland', 'country': 'Scotland', 'file': 'The Redress for Survivors (Historical Child Abuse in Care) (Exceptions to Eligibility) (Scotland) Regulations 2021.txt', 'legislation': 'Scottish Statutory Instruments', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2021/413/note/made', 'year': '2021'}","Prospective

(a)
take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances—
(i)
to establish whether person A has any views in relation to the notice which person A wishes to be taken into account, and if so, to obtain those views,
(ii)
to establish whether person B has any views in relation to the notice which person B wishes to be taken into account, and if so, to obtain those views, and
(b)
take into account—
(i)
any views of which the senior constable becomes aware as a result of paragraph (a), and

Scotland,"A retailer in Scotland is considering selling alcohol below the minimum unit price due to competitive pressures. They want to know the legal implications. Under the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012, what are the retailer's obligations, and what penalties could they face for non-compliance? ","Under the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012, which amends the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, retailers in Scotland are required to sell alcohol at or above a minimum unit price (MPU) set by the Scottish Ministers. This rule applies to all licensed premises, including shops, bars, restaurants, and temporary events with occasional licenses. The minimum price condition is detailed in Schedule 3, Paragraph 6A for premises licenses and Schedule 4, Paragraph 5A for occasional licenses. Alcohol must be sold at a minimum price calculated by multiplying the MPU by the strength and volume of the alcohol. As amended by The Alcohol (Minimum Price per Unit) (Scotland) Order 2018, the current MPU is set at 65 pence per unit. Retailers must comply with this minimum price, and selling alcohol below this threshold constitutes a breach of licensing conditions. If a retailer fails to meet the minimum pricing requirement, Section 36 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 allows the licensing board to review the premises license and impose penalties as needed. Following a review, the board may suspend the license temporarily, revoke the license entirely, or modify the license conditions to enforce compliance. These penalties aim to uphold public health and ensure responsible alcohol sales.","Under the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012, retailers in Scotland who sell alcohol below the minimum unit price may be committing an offense. The retailer's primary obligation is to comply with the minimum pricing provisions set out in Section 1 of the 2012 Act, which requires that alcohol must not be sold on the premises at a price below its minimum price.

If a retailer sells alcohol below the minimum unit price, they could face the following penalties:

* Offense under section 3 of the Act: The retailer may be guilty of an offense under section 3 of the Act, which carries a maximum fine of £5,000.
* Civil liability: The retailer may also be liable to pay a civil penalty, which can be up to 50% of the revenue generated from the sale of the offending alcohol.

The retailer's specific obligations under the Act include:

* Ensuring that all alcoholic beverages sold on the premises are at or above the minimum unit price
* Having a policy in place to prevent selling alcohol below the minimum unit price
* Keeping records and accounting for all sales made

It is worth noting that retailers who comply with the minimum pricing provisions and do not sell alcohol below the minimum unit price will be eligible for an exemption from civil penalties.

In addition, section 3(1) of the Act states ""A person who sells or supplies any intoxicating liquor at a price which is less than the price prescribed in regulations made under section 2 above commits an offense and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale."" 

This means that retailers can commit an offense and face penalties if they fail to comply with the minimum pricing provisions, even if it's just for one sale.","['', ' Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, Schedule 3, Paragraph 6A ', ' Premises Licence Mandatory Conditions\r\n', ' Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, Schedule 4, Paragraph 5A ', ' Occasional Licence Mandatory Conditions\r\n', ' The Alcohol (Minimum Price per Unit) (Scotland) Order 2018 ', ' Minimum Unit Pricing for Alcohol in Scotland\r\n', ' Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, Section 36 ', ' Application for Review of Premises Licence:']",11,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Section 1 of the 2012 Act inserted provisions into schedules 3 and 4 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, introducing a further mandatory condition of premises licences and occasional licences. The condition is that alcohol must not be sold on the premises at a price below its minimum price. These provisions are the “minimum pricing provisions”.
Section 2(1) of the 2012 Act provides that the minimum pricing provisions expire 6 years after section 1 of the 2012 Act came fully into force unless an Order is made under section 2(2) of that Act to continue the effect of those provisions. Section 1 of the 2012 Act came fully into force on 1 May 2018. This Order continues the effect of the minimum pricing provisions.

Scotland,"A parent in Scotland believes their child requires additional support in school due to a learning difficulty. Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 (as amended), what rights does the child have, and what steps can the parent take to secure the necessary support?","Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004, as amended, children in Scotland who require additional support due to learning difficulties are legally entitled to specific rights. Education authorities have a duty to assess and provide for these needs when required. According to Section 8(1), if a parent requests an assessment to determine whether their child has additional support needs or requires a Co-ordinated Support Plan (CSP), the education authority must comply with this request unless it is deemed unreasonable. Following assessment, Section 4(1)(a) requires the education authority to make adequate and efficient provision for the identified needs, which can include specialized resources or tailored teaching approaches. If a child’s support needs involve multiple agencies, such as social work or healthcare in addition to education, Section 9(1) ensures they are entitled to a CSP, a document outlining coordinated support across agencies. Parents also have the right, under Section 12(2), to be actively involved in developing and reviewing support plans to ensure that their child’s educational requirements are fully understood and addressed. If disagreements arise regarding the support provided or decisions made, Section 18(1) grants parents the right to appeal to the Additional Support Needs Tribunal for Scotland, which can make binding rulings on disputes related to additional support. These legislative provisions provide a strong framework for ensuring children’s educational needs are met and give parents a clear process to advocate for the support their child requires.","Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 (as amended), a child in Scotland has the right to additional support in school if they have a learning difficulty. The child's rights include:

1. The right to an Educational Psychologist assessment to identify the nature and extent of their learning difficulty.
2. The right to a Learning Difficulty Assessment to determine the impact of their learning difficulty on their education.
3. The right to a Personalised Support Plan (PSP) that outlines the additional support needed to help them succeed in school.

To secure the necessary support, the parent can take the following steps:

1. Request an Educational Psychologist assessment: The parent should ask the school to assess the child's learning difficulty and provide recommendations for support.
2. Make a complaint to the local authority: If the school is not providing adequate support, the parent can make a formal complaint to the local authority, which is responsible for ensuring that children with additional support needs receive the necessary support.
3. Seek advice from the Scottish Association for Disabled Children (SADC) or other organizations that specialize in supporting children with learning difficulties.
4. Meet with the school's Support Team: The parent should meet with the school's Support Team to discuss the child's progress and identify areas where additional support is needed.
5. Request a Learning Difficulty Assessment: The parent can request a Learning Difficulty Assessment, which will provide more detailed information about the child's learning difficulty and the impact it has on their education.
6. Review and revise the Personalised Support Plan (PSP): The parent should review the PSP regularly to ensure that it remains relevant and effective in providing support for the child.

The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 also provides for the right to appeal if a decision regarding additional support is not satisfactory. If the parent is dissatisfied with the school's response, they can appeal to the Scottish Government's First Minister's Office or seek support from an independent appeals body.

It's essential to note that every child's situation is unique, and the specific steps required will depend on the individual circumstances of the child and the local authority's policies and procedures. The parent should work closely with the school and other professionals to ensure that the child receives the necessary support to succeed in school.",['Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004'],11,True,"Prospective

                                       * Making B dependent on, or subordinate to, A (the abuser);
                                       * Isolating B from friends, relatives, or other sources of social interaction or support;
                                       * Controlling, regulating, or monitoring B's day-to-day activities;
                                       * Depriving B of, or restricting, freedom of action;
                                       * Frightening, humiliating, degrading, or punishing B.
While the Act does not provide specific protective orders, the individual may apply for a Non-Molestation Order or an Occupation Order under the Family Homes and Domestic Violence (NothernIreland) Order 1998. A Non-Molestation Order can prohibit the abuser from molesting the applicant or a relevant child, and an Occupation Order can regulate the occupation of the shared residence. Additionally, Sections 25 to 28 of the Act offer special measures in civil proceedings to support victims, such as prohibiting the abuser from cross-examining the victim in person.
To secure these protections, the individual should:
                                       1. Report the abuse to the Police Service of NothernIreland to initiate criminal proceedings under the Act.
                                       2. Seek legal advice to apply for a Non-Molestation Order or an Occupation Order through the courts.
                                       3. Utilize the special measures provided in the Act during any civil proceedings to ensure their safety and well-being.","Under the Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (Northern Ireland) 2021, an individual experiencing domestic abuse in Northern Ireland has several legal protections available. Firstly, they can apply for a Non-Harassment Order, which prohibits their abuser from contacting them directly or through any third party.

To secure this protection, the individual should first contact the police and report the abuse. They will then need to fill out an application form for a Non-Harassment Order, providing as much detail as possible about the abuse they are experiencing. The police will review the application and, if necessary, issue a warning letter or court order.

Alternatively, the individual can also apply for a Protection from Harassment Order (PHO), which provides similar protection but is typically used in cases where the abuser has already been convicted of harassment. To obtain a PHO, the individual must demonstrate that they are at risk of being harassed and provide evidence to support this claim.

In addition to these orders, the Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act also introduces new measures to protect victims of domestic abuse in the courts. For example, victims can automatically be deemed ""vulnerable"" for the purposes of determining whether a participation direction should be made, which means that the court will not need to determine their vulnerability before making decisions about how to proceed.

It is essential that the individual seeking protection takes these steps as soon as possible after experiencing abuse. The police and courts are required by law to treat victims of domestic abuse with sensitivity and respect, and to prioritize their safety above all else.

In terms of what the abuser should not do, it is crucial that they do not attempt to contact or harass the individual further while a protection order is in place. Any failure to comply with the terms of the protection order can result in serious consequences, including arrest and prosecution.

Overall, the Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act provides a range of important protections for individuals experiencing domestic abuse in Northern Ireland. By applying for one of these orders or working with the police and courts, the individual can help ensure their safety and well-being.","['', ' Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (NothernIreland) 2021\r\n', ' Family Homes and Domestic Violence (NothernIreland) Order 1998']",11,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

NothernIreland,"An employee in NothernIreland suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage. Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015, what are their rights, and what steps can they take to address the issue?","Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015, an employee in NothernIreland who suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage (NMW) has specific rights and actionable steps to address the issue. The Act mandates that employees must be paid at least the NMW, as set out in Section 1(1), which establishes the legal entitlement to minimum wage for all qualifying workers. Employers are legally required to keep accurate records of wage payments under Section 9 of the Act. These records should be sufficient to demonstrate that an employee is being paid at least the NMW. Therefore, the first step for the employee is to review their pay records to confirm any potential underpayment. Should there be a discrepancy, Section 10 grants the employee the right to formally request access to these records, enabling them to verify their calculations against the NMW requirement. If the employee identifies an underpayment, they should raise this issue with their employer, as it may be an oversight. If the employer fails to resolve the issue, the employee can escalate the matter to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the body responsible for enforcing compliance. While Section 13 of the Act authorizes the Secretary of State to appoint officers for enforcement purposes, Section 14 provides HMRC officers with the power to issue enforcement notices if employers are found non-compliant.  While the Act provides the primary framework, the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015 offer additional details for specific situations, such as valuing accommodation benefits or adjusting for absences, which can influence wage calculations. For most straightforward underpayment cases, the Act alone provides the necessary rights and procedures, with the Regulations supporting only in specific circumstances affecting wage calculation. In addition to these provisions, the Employment Rights (NothernIreland) Order 1996 is also relevant as it grants the employee a procedural framework for seeking redress if they are not compensated as per the NMW. Under the 1996 Order, if an employee experiences a sustained issue with underpayment, they have the right to file a claim with an Industrial Tribunal. This Order, though not specifically addressing minimum wage rates, is essential for the employee’s right to fair wages, as it permits claims for unlawful deduction of wages or breach of contract, allowing the employee to recover underpaid amounts. The 1996 Order thus complements the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 by establishing legal recourse in cases of wage disputes.","An employee in NothernIreland who suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage has several rights under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015. Here's a step-by-step guide to help them address the issue:

1. **Check their pay packet**: Ensure that their pay is consistent with the national minimum wage for NothernIreland, which is currently £9.50 per hour.
2. **Consult employment contract or agreement**: Review their employment contract or any agreements they have signed to understand their specific pay rate and any provisions related to overtime, bonuses, or deductions.
3. **Seek clarification from employer**: If the employee is unsure about their pay rate, they should discuss it with their employer. They can say something like, ""I'm concerned that my pay might be below the national minimum wage. Can you confirm whether I am being paid correctly?""
4. **Request a pay review**: If the employer confirms that the employee's pay is indeed below the national minimum wage, the employee should request a pay review to rectify the situation.
5. **File a complaint with ACAS (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service)**: If the issue cannot be resolved through discussion or negotiation with their employer, the employee can file a complaint with ACAS. This is a free and impartial service that helps resolve employment disputes.
6. **Consider seeking support from an employment rights organization**: Organizations like the Northern Ireland Employment Rights Centre (NIERC) or the TUC (Trade Union Congress) may provide guidance and support to help the employee navigate the process.
7. **Take legal action if necessary**: If the issue is not resolved through negotiation, the employee may need to consider taking legal action against their employer.

It's essential for employees in NothernIreland to be aware of their rights under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015. If they suspect they are being paid below the national minimum wage, they should not hesitate to seek help and support from relevant organizations or authorities.","['', ' National Minimum Wage Act 1998\r\n', ' National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015\r\n', ' The Employment Rights (NothernIreland) Order 1996']",11,True,"Prospective

NothernIreland,"An employee in NothernIreland has recently lost a child and is unsure about their entitlement to bereavement leave and pay. Under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022, what are their rights, and how can they access them?","Under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022, an employee in NothernIreland who has recently lost a child is entitled to bereavement leave, and if they meet certain criteria, they may also be eligible for bereavement pay. Article 112EA(1)-(3) defines a ""bereaved parent"" as an employee who meets specified relationship conditions with the deceased child, which may include a caregiving role before the child’s death. Employees who lose a child under 18, or experience a stillbirth after 24 weeks of pregnancy, are entitled to at least two weeks of bereavement leave under Article 112EA(5). This leave can be taken either as a single two-week block or in two separate one-week periods. According to Article 112EA(6), this leave must be taken within at least 56 days (eight weeks) from the date of the child’s death, providing flexibility within that period.
If an employee loses more than one child, Article 112EA(7) entitles them to bereavement leave for each child. Article 112EB outlines rights during and after bereavement leave, specifying that employees on leave retain most employment terms and conditions (excluding remuneration). According to Article 112EB(1)(a)-(c), employees are entitled to return to their original or an equivalent job after bereavement leave. Furthermore, Article 112EB(3) provides that if bereavement leave coincides with other types of parental leave (such as maternity or paternity leave), the right to return applies across the entire period of absence.
To access bereavement leave, Article 112ED(a) requires employees to notify their employer as soon as reasonably practicable, specifying the intended dates for leave. Employers are obligated to grant this leave and cannot delay or refuse it. If the employee is also eligible for statutory bereavement pay, they must provide notice and any required documentation as directed under Articles 112ED(a) and (c).","Under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, an employee in Northern Ireland who has recently lost a child is entitled to bereavement leave and pay. The employee's rights include:

1. **Entitlement to bereavement leave**: The employee is entitled to take up to 12 weeks of paid bereavement leave following the death of their child.
2. **Eligibility for statutory bereavement pay**: The employee may be eligible for statutory bereavement pay, which is a taxable benefit that replaces part or all of their lost earnings during their bereavement leave.
3. **Contractual rights to bereavement leave**: The employee's contractual rights to bereavement leave and pay will take precedence over the statutory entitlements.

To access these rights, the employee should:

1. **Check their employment contract**: Review their employment contract to understand their contractual entitlements to bereavement leave and pay.
2. **Notify their employer**: Inform their employer about the death of their child and provide any necessary documentation, such as a death certificate.
3. **Make a claim for statutory bereavement pay**: If they are not receiving sufficient paid bereavement leave from their employer, they may need to make a claim for statutory bereavement pay through the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland.

It is essential for the employee to familiarize themselves with the specifics of their employment contract and the relevant legislation to understand their rights and entitlements.","['', ' Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022']",11,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers inserted into the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 (N.I. 16) (the “1996 Order”) by the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 (c. 5).
The Regulations revoke and re-enact the provisions of the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023 which would otherwise cease to have effect by virtue of Article 251(1A) of the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996.
These Regulations provide for a statutory entitlement for bereaved parents who are employees to take up to two weeks’ leave from their job called parental bereavement leave in the 56 weeks following the death of a child.
Part 2 relates to entitlement to parental bereavement leave. The right to take parental bereavement leave is conferred by regulation 4 which sets out the conditions for entitlement which must be satisfied by the employee in order to take parental bereavement leave. These include substantive requirements, such as the employee falling within the definition of a bereaved parent (in particular, specifying the types of parental relationships in respect of which the new entitlement arises), as well as procedural requirements, such as the employee giving appropriate notices to their employer. Where an employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave under regulation 4 as the result of the death of more than one child, the employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave in respect of each child.
Regulation 5 sets out the number of weeks of parental bereavement leave that are available to a bereaved parent and gives an employee the option of taking either one or two weeks’ parental bereavement leave. The weeks taken as parental bereavement leave do not need to be taken consecutively. It also provides that parental bereavement leave may only be taken within the period of 56 weeks beginning with the date of the child’s death.
Regulation 6 details the notice requirements and other information the bereaved parent must provide to their employer before taking parental bereavement leave. An employee does not need to provide notice in writing to his or her employer, but the length of notice required to book and cancel parental bereavement leave will vary depending on whether the period the employee intends to take as parental bereavement leave falls within 56 days of the child’s death or later. Regulations 7 and 8 respectively set out when an employee’s period of bereavement leave may start and what happens when a period of parental bereavement leave is interrupted by another type of statutory leave under Part 9 of the 1996 Order.
Part 3 contains provisions applicable in relation to the taking of parental bereavement leave. Regulation 9 elaborates on the new Article 112EB of the 1996 Order, by providing that an employee is entitled during his or her absence on leave to the benefit of all of his or her terms and conditions of employment apart from the right to remuneration (excluded by Article 112EB(2)(b)); also that the employee is subject to all of the obligations under those terms and conditions except in so far as they are inconsistent with the right to take parental bereavement leave (the exception appears in Article 112EB(1)(b)). Regulations 10 and 11 provide for an employee’s right to return to work after taking a period of parental bereavement leave, distinguishing the case where the leave was an isolated period of absence from the case where it followed another period of statutory leave. Regulations 12 and 13 provide that an employee entitled to parental bereavement leave is protected from detriment and dismissal attributable to the fact that they took or sought to take parental bereavement leave.
Part 4 contains provisions applicable where an employee has a contractual right to parental bereavement leave, in addition to the statutory right contained within these Regulations.
Part 5 (regulations 16 to 22) contains provisions in respect of the Transitional arrangements that will ensure a continuity of entitlement between the revoked Regulations and current Regulations. This part also contains the revocation of the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023.

NothernIreland,"A tenant in NothernIreland has been served an eviction notice by their landlord, giving them four weeks to vacate the property. The tenant has lived there for two years under a periodic tenancy. Under the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, is the notice period valid, and what rights does the tenant have?","Under the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, a landlord’s notice to quit a property must meet specific statutory notice periods based on the length of the tenancy. This Act amends the Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006, particularly Article 14, to reflect updated notice requirements. For a tenant who has lived in the property for two years under a periodic tenancy, Section 11 of the 2022 Act amends Article 14 of the 2006 Order to specify that the landlord must provide at least 4 months’ notice before requiring the tenant to vacate. This 4-month period applies to tenancies that have existed for more than 12 months but not more than 3 years (as outlined in the new Article 14(1A)(b)). Because the landlord provided only four weeks’ notice, this does not satisfy the legal requirement, rendering the notice invalid. The tenant has the right to remain in the property until a valid notice to quit is served that meets the legally required notice period. Under Section 11 of the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, which amends Article 14 of the Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006, landlords are required to give a minimum 4-month notice for tenancies that have lasted more than 12 months but not more than 3 years. Because the tenant has lived in the property for two years, the landlord’s four-week notice does not meet this requirement and is therefore invalid. The tenant may choose to inform the landlord in writing that the notice is invalid due to the insufficient notice period, referencing Article 14(1), which states that a notice to quit is only valid if it complies with the minimum notice periods required by law. If the landlord proceeds with eviction attempts despite the invalid notice, the tenant may seek legal remedies. While specific injunctions or protections against harassment are not outlined within this tenancy legislation, the tenant may still seek legal assistance through broader NothernIreland housing or civil law protections to prevent an unlawful eviction and maintain peaceful possession of the property.","Under the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, the landlord has given the tenant four weeks to vacate the property. However, the statute requires a minimum of six months' notice for a periodic tenancy that exceeds one year.

Since the tenant has lived in the property for two years, the landlord should have provided at least six months' notice to vacate, not four weeks. Therefore, the notice period is invalid under this legislation.

As a result, the tenant's rights are as follows:

1. **Invalid notice period**: The landlord's notice period of four weeks does not meet the statutory requirement of six months', and therefore it is considered invalid.
2. **Right to remain in the property**: Given that the notice period was short, the tenant has the right to continue living in the property until a valid notice period can be served.
3. **No forced eviction**: The landlord cannot evict the tenant immediately due to the invalid notice period. If the landlord wants to terminate the tenancy, they must provide the correct amount of notice (at least six months') as per the statute.

In summary, the tenant has a valid claim that the notice period is short and therefore should not be enforced by the landlord. The tenant can continue living in the property until a valid notice period can be served.","['', ' Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022 ', ' Section 11\r\n', ' Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006 ', ' Article 14']",11,True,"Prospective

NothernIreland,"An individual in NothernIreland is being harassed and stalked by an ex-partner, causing them significant distress. Under the Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022, what legal protections are available to them, and what steps should they take to ensure their safety?","Under the Protection from Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022, individuals in NothernIreland who are being harassed and stalked by an ex-partner can rely on specific legal protections. The Act clearly defines stalking as a criminal offense in Section 1, where engaging in a course of conduct causing another person to experience fear, alarm, or substantial distress constitutes stalking. Such conduct includes following, contacting, monitoring usage of electronic communications, and other invasive behaviors. Offenders can face severe penalties, with up to 10 years imprisonment or a fine upon conviction on indictment, or up to 12 months imprisonment or a statutory maximum fine upon summary conviction. Additionally, the Act allows for Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs), detailed in Section 7, which the Chief Constable can apply for. These orders are designed to prevent further stalking activities by imposing specific prohibitions or requirements on the stalker. The eligibility for an SPO is based on evidence that the individual has engaged in stalking, poses a risk related to stalking, and that the order is necessary to protect someone from this risk. These orders can be applied against anyone residing in, or intending to visit, NothernIreland. The duration of these orders is addressed in Section 9, where an SPO can last for a minimum of two years or until further court order. The court may specify that some conditions within the SPO remain effective until further judicial review while setting others for fixed periods. This flexibility allows the protective measures to be adapted over time to match the needs of the situation. For their safety, affected individuals should report stalking incidents to the Police Service of NothernIreland (PSNI), enabling legal proceedings that could include the issuance of an SPO. Consulting legal advice and engaging with support services are also advisable steps to ensure comprehensive protection and support.","The individual can seek a Stalking Protection Order (SPO), which provides protection from stalking behaviors. To obtain an SPO, the individual will need to demonstrate that they have been subjected to persistent and intimidating behavior by their ex-partner.

Here are the steps the individual can take:

1. **Report the harassment**: The individual should report the harassment to the police immediately. They can contact the Northern Ireland Police Service (NIPS) or submit a report online.
2. **Apply for a Stalking Protection Order**: Once the police have taken a report, the individual can apply for an SPO. This will involve providing evidence of the stalking behavior and attending a court hearing to demonstrate that they are at risk of harm.
3. **Provide supporting documentation**: The individual may need to provide supporting documentation, such as witness statements, CCTV footage, or records of communication with their ex-partner.
4. **Attend a court hearing**: If the application is successful, the court will issue an SPO, which will last for two years from the date it was issued. The individual can apply for an extension if necessary.

**Additional steps to ensure safety:**

1. **Obtain a Non-Harassing Behaviour Order (NHBO)**: In addition to an SPO, the individual may also be able to obtain an NHBO, which restricts their ex-partner's behavior.
2. **Change your phone number and email address**: To prevent further communication from their ex-partner, the individual should consider changing their phone number and email address.
3. **Increase home security**: The individual may want to increase home security measures, such as installing CCTV cameras or alarm systems.
4. **Seek support**: It is essential for the individual to seek support from friends, family, or a counselor to help them cope with the emotional impact of the harassment.

**Important note:**

While an SPO can provide protection, it is not a guarantee that the ex-partner will comply with its terms. The individual should remain vigilant and continue to report any further incidents of stalking behavior to the police.

The Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 aims to provide victims of stalking with early intervention and protection from perpetrators. By taking these steps, the individual can help ensure their safety and well-being.","['', ' Protection from Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022']",11,True,"Meaning of act associated with stalking and risk associated with stalking
