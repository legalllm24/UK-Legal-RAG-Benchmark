from which a person removed to that country will not be removed or sent to another country in contravention of any international law, and
(ii)
in which any person who is seeking asylum or who has had an asylum determination will both have their claim determined and be treated in accordance with that country’s obligations under international law.

Decisions based on particular individual circumstances
(1)
Section 2 does not prevent—
(a)
the Secretary of State or an immigration officer from deciding (under any applicable provision of, or made under, the Immigration Acts) whether the Republic of Rwanda is a safe country for the person in question, based on compelling evidence relating specifically to the person’s particular individual circumstances (rather than on the grounds that the Republic of Rwanda is not a safe country in general), or
(b)
a court or tribunal considering a review of, or an appeal against, a relevant decision to the extent that the review or appeal is brought on the grounds that the Republic of Rwanda is not a safe country for the person in question, based on compelling evidence relating specifically to the person’s particular individual circumstances (rather than on the grounds that the Republic of Rwanda is not a safe country in general).
(2)
But subsection (1) does not permit a decision-maker to consider any matter, claim or complaint to the extent that it relates to the issue of whether the Republic of Rwanda will or may remove or send the person in question to another State in contravention of any of its international obligations (including in particular its obligations under the Refugee Convention).
(3)
Where a court or tribunal is considering a review or an appeal as mentioned in subsection (1)(b), any power of the court or tribunal to grant an interim remedy (whether on an application of the person in question or otherwise) is restricted as follows.
(4)
The court or tribunal may grant an interim remedy that prevents or delays, or that has the effect of preventing or delaying, the removal of the person to the Republic of Rwanda only if the court or tribunal is satisfied that the person would, before the review or appeal is determined, face a real, imminent and foreseeable risk of serious and irreversible harm if removed to the Republic of Rwanda.
(5)
Subsections (4) to (8) of section 39 of the Illegal Migration Act 2023 (examples of serious and irreversible harm) apply (with any necessary modifications) for the purposes of subsections (3) and (4) as they apply for the purposes of that Act.
