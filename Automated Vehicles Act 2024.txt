Basic concepts
(1)
This section applies for the purposes of this Part.
(2)
A vehicle “satisfies the self-driving test” if—
(a)
it is designed or adapted with the intention that a feature of the vehicle will allow it to travel autonomously, and
(b)
it is capable of doing so, by means of that feature, safely and legally.
(3)
Whether a vehicle satisfies the test is to be assessed by reference to the location and circumstances of that intended travel (and may differ in respect of different locations and circumstances).
(4)
A “feature” of a vehicle is a combination of mechanical or electronic operations that equipment of the vehicle performs.
(5)
A vehicle travels “autonomously” if—
(a)
it is being controlled not by an individual but by equipment of the vehicle, and
(b)
neither the vehicle nor its surroundings are being monitored by an individual with a view to immediate intervention in the driving of the vehicle.
(6)
References to “control” of a vehicle are to control of the motion of the vehicle.
(7)
A vehicle that travels autonomously does so—
(a)
“safely” if it travels to an acceptably safe standard, and
(b)
“legally” if it travels with an acceptably low risk of committing a traffic infraction.
(8)
In assessing whether a vehicle is capable of travelling autonomously and safely, the Secretary of State must have particular regard to the statement of safety principles.

Statement of safety principles
(1)
The Secretary of State must prepare a statement of the principles that the Secretary of State proposes to apply in assessing, for the purposes of this Part, whether a vehicle is capable of travelling autonomously and safely.
(2)
The principles must be framed with a view to securing that—
(a)
authorised automated vehicles will achieve a level of safety equivalent to, or higher than, that of careful and competent human drivers, and
(b)
road safety in Great Britain will be better as a result of the use of authorised automated vehicles on roads than it would otherwise be.
(3)
In preparing the statement, the Secretary of State must consult such representative organisations as the Secretary of State thinks fit.
(4)
Those organisations must include organisations appearing to the Secretary of State to represent—
(a)
the interests of businesses involved, or likely to be involved, in the manufacture or operation of mechanically propelled road vehicles designed to travel autonomously,
(b)
the interests of road users, and
(c)
the cause of road safety.
(5)
The prepared statement must be laid before Parliament.
(6)
The statement takes effect if both Houses of Parliament resolve that it should.
(7)
The Secretary of State may revise or replace the statement that has effect under this section; and subsections (2) to (5) apply to a revision or replacement.
(8)
A revision or replacement takes effect at the end of the period of 40 days beginning with the day on which it is laid, unless either House resolves before then that it should not.
(9)
For the purposes of subsection (8)—
(a)
where a revision or replacement is laid before each House on different days, the later day is to be taken to be the day on which it was laid before both Houses, and
(b)
in counting any period of 40 days, no account is to be taken of any time during which Parliament is dissolved or prorogued or during which both Houses are adjourned for more than four days.
(10)
The power in section 3 may not be exercised until a statement has effect under this section.

Power to authorise
(1)
The Secretary of State may authorise a road vehicle for use as an automated vehicle if—
(a)
in the opinion of the Secretary of State, the vehicle satisfies the self-driving test by reference to intended travel on a road (in at least some circumstances), and
(b)
any applicable initial authorisation requirements are met (see section 5).
(2)
An automated vehicle authorisation may—
(a)
be limited to an individual vehicle, or individual vehicles, identified in the authorisation, or
(b)
extend to all vehicles of a type described in the authorisation.
(3)
The description of a type under subsection (2)(b) must be formulated with a view to securing that the Secretary of State’s assessment for the purposes of subsection (1)(a), and the contents of the authorisation, will be equally applicable in relation to any vehicle of that type.

Authorised automation features
(1)
An automated vehicle authorisation must identify the feature or features by virtue of which (in the opinion of the Secretary of State) the vehicle satisfies the self-driving test.
(2)
More than one feature may be identified if it appears to the Secretary of State that each can reasonably be characterised as amounting to a distinct capability of the vehicle.
(3)
In relation to each feature identified in the authorisation, the authorisation must specify—
(a)
whether the mode of operation of the feature is “user-in-charge” or “no-user-in-charge”,
(b)
how the feature is engaged and disengaged, and
(c)
the locations and circumstances by reference to which (in the opinion of the Secretary of State) the vehicle satisfies the self-driving test by virtue of the feature.
(4)
The locations specified in the authorisation may include places other than roads.
(5)
If more than one feature is identified in an authorisation, the Secretary of State must discharge the duty in subsection (3)(b) in a way that will make it possible to ascertain which feature (if any) is engaged at any given moment.

The person may by an appropriate communication with equipment of the vehicle make any direction that could be given to a driver of the vehicle.
(3)
For that purpose a communication is “appropriate” if it is a communication that equipment of the vehicle could reasonably be expected to receive and react to.
(4)
In determining whether subsection (3) is satisfied, regard is to be had to—
(a)
any relevant authorisation requirements or operator licensing regulations, and
(b)
the design and intended function of the equipment.
(5)
For the purpose of determining whether a vehicle has committed a traffic infraction, a direction made in accordance with subsection (2) has effect as if it were a direction given to a driver of the vehicle.
(6)
But a vehicle with an authorised user-in-charge feature does not commit a traffic infraction by not complying with the direction if—
(a)
the vehicle immediately issues a transition demand,
(b)
by the end of the transition period, equipment of the vehicle communicates the substance of the direction to the user-in-charge in a way that the user-in-charge could be expected to understand, and
(c)
that way of responding to the direction does not breach authorisation requirements.
(7)
A direction the substance of which is communicated as described in subsection (6)(b) (and in a way that does not breach authorisation requirements) is effective against the user-in-charge as soon as—
(a)
the user-in-charge assumes control of the vehicle, or
(b)
(if earlier) the transition period ends,
as if it had been given to that individual as the driver.

must give a copy of the warrant to any person appearing to be in charge of the premises at the earliest opportunity (if possible before entering the premises),
(ii)
if no such copy is given during the period of entry on the premises, must leave a copy of the warrant in a prominent place on the premises, and
(iii)
must return the warrant to the court from which it was issued as soon as reasonably practicable with an endorsement summarising the exercise of the powers in subsection (2);
(c)
if no person appearing to be in charge of the premises is present, must leave the premises as effectively secured against trespassers as the inspector found them;
(d)
must make and retain a written record of the powers exercised in respect of the premises.
(10)
The Secretary of State must arrange for the publication of information on the exercise of the powers in subsection (2) at such intervals as seem appropriate.

An automated passenger service is “provided in” an area if (and only if) it involves passengers being carried in that area.
(4)
Subject to subsection (5), the “appropriate national authority” is—
(a)
the Secretary of State, in relation to a permit for the provision of a service in England;
(b)
the Scottish Ministers, in relation to a permit for the provision of a service in Scotland;
