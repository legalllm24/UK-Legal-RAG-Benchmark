Unitedkingdom,"An employee in England is currently on maternity leave under the Employment Rights Act 1996. During her leave, her employer announces a redundancy process due to company restructuring. Additionally, there are health and safety concerns at the workplace that might affect her return. Considering the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (as amended), the Equality Act 2010, the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, and relevant case law, what protections does she have during redundancy, and how should the employer proceed?","Under the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999, specifically Regulation 10, if an employee on maternity leave is at risk of redundancy, she must be offered any suitable alternative vacancy available before it is offered to other employees, giving her priority for redeployment opportunities. The Equality Act 2010, particularly Section 18, prohibits discrimination because of pregnancy or maternity, requiring employers to ensure that redundancy selection criteria do not disadvantage employees on maternity leave to avoid unlawful discrimination claims. Regarding health and safety, the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, Regulation 16, mandates employers to perform a specific risk assessment for new or expectant mothers, and if risks are identified and cannot be avoided, the employer must adjust her working conditions or hours, offer suitable alternative work on no less favorable terms, or if no alternative is available, suspend her on full pay. Relevant case law, such as Sefton Borough Council v Wainwright [2014] EWCA Civ 953, confirms the obligation to offer suitable alternative employment to employees on maternity leave before others. Therefore, the employer must conduct a fair and non-discriminatory redundancy process, prioritize the employee for any suitable alternative positions, and address health and safety concerns by performing risk assessments and taking necessary actions to protect the employee.","

**Employee Protections During Redundancy and Maternity Leave**

1. **Maternity Leave Protection Under ERA 1996:**
   - The employee is protected from being dismissed or made redundant during her maternity leave unless the redundancy is unrelated to her pregnancy.

2. **Redundancy Protection Under MPLR 1999:**
   - Upon returning from maternity leave, she is protected against redundancy for a period (26 weeks from the start of leave or until return).

3. **Health and Safety Protections:**
   - The employer must provide a safe working environment under HSWR 1999.
   - She may refuse to return if conditions are unsafe, potentially invoking health and safety laws.

4. **Discrimination and Harassment Protection Under EA 2010:**
   - Discrimination based on pregnancy or sex is prohibited; unfair treatment during redundancy is illegal.
   - Health risks due to pregnancy that affect working conditions could constitute harassment.

**Employer Responsibilities:**

1. **Follow Correct Redundancy Procedures:**
   - Ensure redundancy decisions are not motivated by pregnancy-related reasons.

2. **Health and Safety Obligations:**
   - Conduct a health risk assessment before allowing her return.
   - Provide a safe workplace; failing to do so may lead to legal action.

3. **Avoid Discrimination:**
   - Treat all employees equally during restructuring, avoiding discriminatory practices targeting pregnancy-related leave.

4. **Proper Consultation and Communication:**
   - Engage in discussions with the employee regarding her return and redundancy status, following appropriate procedures.

This structured approach ensures both legal compliance and fair treatment for the employee, balancing redundancy processes with health and safety concerns.","['', ' Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999, Regulation 10\r\n', ' Equality Act 2010, Section 18\r\n', ' Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, Regulation 16']",17,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999/3312), the Paternity and Adoption Leave Regulations 2002 (S.I. 2002/2788) and the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/3050). They also amend the Paternity and Adoption Leave (Adoption from Overseas) Regulations 2003 (S.I. 2003/921) and the Shared Parental Leave and Paternity and Adoption Leave (Adoptions from Overseas) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/3092) to ensure equivalent provision for those adopting children from overseas.
The amendments extend existing requirements that apply to employers when redundancy situations arise where an employee is on maternity, adoption or shared parental leave, so that those requirements can also apply during pregnancy and for a period of time after that leave has ended. For those taking shared parental leave who have not taken maternity or adoption leave, there is a six-week threshold of continuous leave that needs to be met for the requirements to apply for a period of time after shared parental leave has ended. Where the six-week threshold is not met, the requirements apply during shared parental leave.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. A full impact assessment has been prepared in relation to the Protection from Redundancy (Pregnancy and Family Leave) Act 2023 and to which this instrument gives effect, and a copy is available at https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3191/publications.","{'category': 'Exclusively or primarily applies to UK', 'country': 'UnitedKingdom', 'file': 'The Maternity Leave, Adoption Leave and Shared Parental Leave (Amendment) Regulations 2024_Superseded by 2024 No. 264.txt', 'legislation': 'UK Draft Statutory Instruments', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2024/9780348254846/note', 'year': '2024'}","Amendment of the 2014 Regulations

Unitedkingdom,"A tenant in England reports a malfunctioning carbon monoxide alarm installed under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (Amendment) Regulations 2022. Despite notifying the landlord, the alarm has not been repaired or replaced after three weeks. The tenant is concerned about safety and compliance. Under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm Regulations 2015 (as amended), what are the landlord's legal obligations, and what actions can the tenant take?","Under Regulation 6 of the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015, when a landlord is served with a remedial notice for breaching one or more duties outlined in Regulation 4(1) (such as failing to install or maintain smoke or carbon monoxide alarms), the landlord must take the specified remedial actions within the timeframe set out in Regulation 5(2)(d), typically 28 days from the notice's issuance. This regulation imposes a clear duty on the landlord to address the breach promptly and ensures tenant safety through enforcement mechanisms. However, Regulation 6(2) provides that a landlord will not be considered in breach of this obligation if they can demonstrate that they have taken all reasonable steps, short of initiating legal proceedings, to comply with the duty. Reasonable steps may include hiring contractors, arranging access to the property, or documenting efforts to resolve tenant-related barriers to compliance. Proper evidence of these steps is crucial to establish the landlord’s diligence. This provision ensures that while landlords are held accountable, genuine efforts to comply are recognized, even if the issue remains unresolved due to circumstances beyond their control.","

**Legal Obligations of the Landlord and Tenant's Recourse Under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm Regulations 2015 (as Amended)**

**Landlord's Legal Obligations:**

1. **Prompt Response Requirement:** Upon receiving a notification from the tenant regarding a malfunctioning carbon monoxide alarm, the landlord must act without undue delay. The amendment specifies that repairs or replacements must be completed as soon as reasonably practical after notification.

2. **Responsibility for Repairs/Replacements:** The landlord is responsible for ensuring that any required repairs or replacements are carried out by them or their authorized agents. This duty applies regardless of whether the tenancy is new or ongoing.

3. **Compliance and Penalties:** Failure to comply with these regulations can lead to enforcement actions, including fines, as landlords are legally bound to maintain safety standards. Local authorities may investigate and impose penalties for non-compliance.

**Tenant's Recourse:**

1. **escalation of Issue:** If the landlord does not address the issue within a reasonable timeframe (as determined by the relevant regulations), the tenant can escalate the matter to local housing or environmental health authorities.

2. **Reporting to Authorities:** The tenant should contact their local Housing Authority or Environmental Health Department to report the landlord's failure to comply. This can lead to enforcement actions, potentially resulting in penalties for both the landlord and tenant if they are found to be non-compliant.

3. **Legal Action:** In severe cases where tenant safety is at risk, the tenant may consider seeking legal advice regarding a potential claim against the landlord for negligence or breach of duty of care.

**Considerations:**

- Landlords should maintain access to the property and have alternative means to obtain necessary parts if possible.
- The amendment removes some previous restrictions, ensuring that landlords cannot avoid responsibility based on certain conditions.

In summary, both parties have legal obligations under the amended regulations. The landlord must act promptly upon notification, while the tenant can escalate issues for enforcement actions, potentially leading to legal consequences for non-compliance.","['', ' Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015 – Regulation 6: Duty of Relevant Landlord to Comply with a Remedial Notice\r\n', ' Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015 – Regulation 4: Duties of Landlords\r\n', ' Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015 – Regulation 5: Remedial Notices']",17,True,"Prohibitions on giving notice seeking possession relating to health and safety

**Apprentice Wage Rights and Remedies in England**

An apprentice who turns 19 and completes their first year of an apprenticeship has specific wage rights under the National Minimum Wage (NMW) Act 1998, as amended by the National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015. Here's a structured overview of their rights and available actions:

### Key Points:
1. **Entitlement to Higher Wage:**
   - After turning 19 and completing one year of their apprenticeship, the apprentice is entitled to receive the standard National Minimum Wage (NMW) for workers aged 19 or older. The employer must cease paying the apprenticeship wage at this point.

2. **NMW Rate Calculation:**
   - The correct wage can be determined using the HMRC Pay Calculator, which provides the minimum hourly rate applicable based on age and employment type.

3. **Employer's Obligation:**
   - Employers are legally required to pay the appropriate NMW rate once the apprentice meets the criteria. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of labor laws.

### Steps for the Apprentice:
1. **Verify Entitlement:**
   - Confirm their age (19 years) and the duration completed in the apprenticeship using the HMRC Pay Calculator or seek advice from an ACAS advisor.

2. **Contact Acas Helpline:**
   - The apprentice can contact Acas, the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service, for guidance on their rights and assistance in resolving the issue with their employer.

3. **Submit a Written Complaint:**
   - Draft a letter detailing the situation, including specifics of their apprenticeship and wages received, to the employer requesting compliance with NMW regulations.

4. **Report to HMRC:**
   - If the employer persists in non-compliance, the apprentice can report the issue to HMRC. This may lead to an investigation and potential enforcement actions against the employer, such as penalties for non-payment.

5. **Seek Legal Advice:**
   - If necessary, consult a solicitor specializing in employment law to explore further options, including potential claims for backpay or other remedies.

### Employer Consequences:
- Employers found non-compliant with NMW regulations face fines and may be subject to additional penalties for repeated offenses or willful neglect.

### Conclusion:
The apprentice has clear rights to receive the correct wage upon meeting the criteria. They can take proactive steps to enforce their rights, which may include seeking external support and escalating the issue formally.","['', ' National Minimum Wage Act 1998:\r\n', ' Employment Rights Act 1996, Section 13:\r\n', ' National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015, Regulation 5(1)']",17,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Unitedkingdom,"Residents in an English town are concerned that their local authority has not implemented separate food waste collections, as required by the Environment Act 2021. The deadline has passed, and there is no plan in place. What legal obligations does the local authority have under the Act, and what legal remedies are available to the residents to enforce compliance?","Under the Environment Act 2021, specifically Section 57, which inserts Section 45AZB into the Environmental Protection Act 1990, local authorities in England are legally obligated to arrange for the separate collection of food waste from households; failure to do so constitutes a breach of statutory duty. Residents can raise the issue with the local authority by submitting formal complaints requesting compliance, engage with local councillors and Members of Parliament (MPs) to advocate for action, and may have standing to apply for a judicial review of the local authority's failure to comply with statutory duties, as established in cases like R (on the application of Greenpeace Ltd) v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1998] Env LR 415; they must act promptly and within three months of the grounds arising.","

**Legal Obligations and Remedies for Non-Compliance with the Environment Act 2021 in England**

**1. Legal Obligations Under the Environment Act 2021:**
   - The Environment Act 2021 imposes specific obligations on local authorities to implement separate food waste collections. These requirements are likely detailed in sections such as section 50 or Schedule 4 of the Act.
   - Failure to meet these obligations constitutes non-compliance, which could lead to enforcement actions and potential penalties.

**2. Legal Remedies for Residents:**
   - **Reporting and Complaints:** Residents can report non-compliance to regulatory bodies like the Environment Agency or local councils. This step is crucial as it raises awareness of the issue and may prompt investigative actions.
   - **Legal Action:** Residents have the right to seek legal remedies if their health and well-being are affected. They can file complaints with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) for breaches of data protection, or pursue judicial review if there are concerns about decision-making processes.
   - **Administrative Actions:** In cases of significant non-compliance affecting public health, residents might consider reporting to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) or seeking injunctive relief through the courts.

**3. Enforcement Mechanisms:**
   - Local authorities may face enforcement actions such as fines or penalties for failing to meet food waste collection requirements.
   - The Environment Agency and other regulatory bodies can conduct investigations and may issue notices requiring compliance within a specified timeframe.

**4. Standing to Sue:**
   - Residents have standing to take legal action against local authorities if their non-compliance with the Environment Act 2021 directly impacts their well-being and rights, such as those related to public health or environmental protection.

In conclusion, while the local authority has a clear obligation under the Environment Act 2021, residents can enforce compliance through reporting, complaints, and legal action if necessary. This approach ensures that statutory requirements are met and upholds community standards.","['', ' Environment Act 2021, Section 57 (inserting Section 45AZB into the Environmental Protection Act 1990)\r\n', ' Environmental Protection Act 1990, Section 45AZB (as inserted by the Environment Act 2021)']",17,True,"Prospective

Wales,"An employee lives in Wales but works in England. They are planning to take Shared Parental Leave (SPL) following the birth of their child. They are unsure how the differences between Welsh and English regulations might affect their entitlement and whether their residence in Wales impacts their rights. Under the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, what are their rights, and does their place of residence affect their entitlement? ","Under the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, which are authorized by the Employment Rights Act 1996, an employee's entitlement to Shared Parental Leave (SPL) is determined by their employment status and specific eligibility criteria, irrespective of their place of residence. The regulations apply uniformly across England and Wales. To qualify for SPL, the employee must have been continuously employed by the same employer for at least 26 weeks by the end of the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth and remain employed at the start of each period of SPL taken. Additionally, their partner must have worked (employed or self-employed) for at least 26 of the 66 weeks before the expected week of childbirth and have earned an average of at least £30 per week in 13 of those weeks. These criteria are outlined in the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, specifically in Part 2, Chapter 1, Regulation 6. Therefore, an employee residing in Wales and working in England is entitled to SPL, provided they meet these eligibility requirements, with their place of residence having no impact on their entitlement.","

**Shared Parental Leave (SPL) Entitlement for an Employee Living in Wales but Working in England**

**1. Overview of Shared Parental Leave:**
   - SPL allows employees to share parental leave with someone who helps care for their child, such as a partner or grandparent.
   - The 2014 Shared Parental Leave Regulations apply across the UK, with potential variations in implementation between countries.

**2. Employment Context:**
   - The employee works in England, falling under English employment law, which governs their SPL entitlements through their employer's terms and conditions.

**3. Residence in Wales:**
   - While the employee resides in Wales, the primary determination of SPL eligibility is based on English employment regulations.
   - Welsh-specific amendments (e.g., document 6) may offer additional protections or expand eligibility for certain groups, such as protected persons or family members, which could enhance entitlements.

**4. Entitlement Criteria:**
   - Eligibility under the 2014 regulations hinges on factors like a qualifying relationship with the child and providing notice through the employer.
   - Residence in Wales does not directly affect SPL eligibility unless specific Welsh provisions apply, such as those related to protected status or family member status.

**5. Key Considerations:**
   - The employee's rights are primarily governed by English law due to their employment in England.
   - While cross-border considerations may exist, the core entitlements under SPL are consistent across the UK, focusing on employment and parental relationship criteria.

**Conclusion:**
The employee is likely eligible for SPL based on the 2014 regulations, with potential enhancements from Welsh-specific amendments. Their residence in Wales does not hinder eligibility as long as they meet the standard criteria. The primary focus remains on their employment status and relationship with the child.","['', ' Employment Rights Act 1996:\r\n', ' Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014']",17,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999/3312), the Paternity and Adoption Leave Regulations 2002 (S.I. 2002/2788) and the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/3050). They also amend the Paternity and Adoption Leave (Adoption from Overseas) Regulations 2003 (S.I. 2003/921) and the Shared Parental Leave and Paternity and Adoption Leave (Adoptions from Overseas) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/3092) to ensure equivalent provision for those adopting children from overseas.
The amendments extend existing requirements that apply to employers when redundancy situations arise where an employee is on maternity, adoption or shared parental leave, so that those requirements can also apply during pregnancy and for a period of time after that leave has ended. For those taking shared parental leave who have not taken maternity or adoption leave, there is a six-week threshold of continuous leave that needs to be met for the requirements to apply for a period of time after shared parental leave has ended. Where the six-week threshold is not met, the requirements apply during shared parental leave.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. A full impact assessment has been prepared in relation to the Protection from Redundancy (Pregnancy and Family Leave) Act 2023 and to which this instrument gives effect, and a copy is available at https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3191/publications.","{'category': 'May contain legislation that applies to Wales', 'country': 'Wales', 'file': 'The Maternity Leave, Adoption Leave and Shared Parental Leave (Amendment) Regulations 2024.txt', 'legislation': 'UK Statutory Instruments', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2024/264/note/made', 'year': '2024'}","Amendments to the Education (Student Support) (Wales) Regulations 2017

Wales,"A tenant in Wales is experiencing severe damp and mold in their rented property, which the landlord has failed to address despite repeated requests. Under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, what are the landlord's obligations regarding repairs and safety, and what actions can the tenant take to enforce these obligations?","Under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, landlords are obligated to maintain rental properties in a condition fit for human habitation. Specifically, Section 91 mandates that landlords must ensure the dwelling is fit for human habitation both at the start and throughout the duration of the tenancy. Section 92 requires landlords to keep in repair the structure and exterior of the dwelling, including drains, gutters, and external pipes, and to maintain installations for the supply of water, gas, electricity, sanitation, space heating, and heating water. If a landlord fails to address severe damp and mold despite repeated requests, the tenant should notify the landlord in writing, keeping records of all communications. If the landlord remains unresponsive, the tenant can contact the local authority's Environmental Health department, which can inspect the property and issue improvement notices. Additionally, the tenant may apply to the court for an order requiring the landlord to carry out repairs. It's advisable to seek legal advice before considering actions like withholding rent or arranging for repairs independently, as these carry legal risks.","

Under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, Welsh tenants experiencing severe damp and mold issues have specific rights and avenues for addressing their concerns. Here's a structured overview of the situation:

1. **Landlord's Responsibilities**:
   - **Repair Obligations**: The landlord must respond to repair notifications from tenants within a reasonable timeframe. If the repair is deemed necessary by the tenant, the landlord must confirm its responsibility and provide a completion timeline.
   - **Fitness for Habitation**: Landlords are legally bound to ensure their properties meet basic safety standards. Excessive damp or mold can render a property unsafe.

2. **Tenant Actions**:
   - **Notification of Repairs**: Tenants should utilize any supplementary terms in their tenancy agreement to formally notify the landlord, detailing the issue and its impact on habitability.
   - **Documentation**: Keep records of all communications with the landlord, including letters or emails, as this evidence may be crucial if disputes arise.

3. **Exemption from Rent Payment**:
   - If the property becomes unsafe due to mold or damp, tenants are not obligated to pay rent. They should provide evidence, possibly through professional assessments or guidelines, to support their claim of uninhabitability.

4. **Recourse Options for Tenants**:
   - **Legal Action**: Tenants can seek compensation or pursue legal action if the landlord fails to address issues, potentially through courts or tribunals.
   - **Local Authorities and CAB**:Tenants can seek advice from local housing councils or Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) for guidance on their rights and potential actions.

5. **Next Steps**:
   - **Formal Complaint**: Advise tenants to send a formal written complaint detailing the issues and their impact on their living conditions.
   - **Escalation**: If issues persist, tenants should escalate to higher authorities or seek legal advice to explore further options.

In summary, tenants in Wales have clear rights regarding repair and safety issues. They should proactively document their concerns and explore all available avenues for resolution, including formal complaints and legal recourse.","['', "" Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, Section 91: Landlord's obligation: fitness for human habitation\r\n"", "" Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, Section 92: Landlord's obligation to keep dwelling in repair""]",17,True,"Repairs

Wales,"A retailer in Wales is found selling alcohol below the minimum unit price set by the Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018. They argue that discounts and promotions allow them to reduce prices. What does the Act stipulate regarding minimum alcohol pricing, and what penalties could the retailer face for non-compliance?","Under the Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018, it is an offence for alcohol retailers in Wales to sell alcohol below the applicable minimum price, regardless of discounts or promotions. The Act defines the minimum price using the formula M × S × V, where M is the minimum unit price (set at 50p), S is the percentage strength of the alcohol, and V is the volume in litres. Non-compliance can result in enforcement actions by local authorities, including the issuance of fixed penalty notices of £200 for each offence. Therefore, retailers must adhere to the minimum pricing regulations, as discounts and promotions do not permit selling alcohol below the established minimum price.","

The Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018 mandates a minimum unit price for alcoholic beverages in Wales. This pricing is calculated based on factors such as alcohol by volume (ABV), ensuring that each type of alcohol is sold at or above this specified minimum. Retailers are legally required to adhere to this pricing, meaning they cannot sell any product below the set threshold, even through discounts or promotions.

Penalties for non-compliance include fines. The severity and number of offenses can lead to increased penalties, potentially escalating to revocation of the retailer's ability to sell alcohol. This enforcement aims to reduce alcohol-related harm by encouraging responsible pricing practices.

In summary, the Act sets a minimum price that must be respected, with consequences for retailers who fail to comply, emphasizing public health goals through controlled alcohol pricing.","['', ' Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018']",17,True,"WELSH STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS

Wales,"A homeowner in Wales wants to build a large extension to their property without applying for planning permission, arguing that it's within permitted development rights. Under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Wales) Order 1995 and recent amendments, what are the rules regarding extensions, and when is planning permission required?","Under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Wales) Order 1995, as amended, specific conditions allow certain extensions to be built without a formal planning application, known as permitted development rights. Below are the key provisions relevant to the homeowner’s question:\nRelevant Provisions for Extensions:\nVolume Limitations:\n                        * Terraced Houses or Properties on Article 1(5) Land: The cumulative volume of the extension must not exceed the volume of the original dwellinghouse by more than 50 cubic meters or 10% (whichever is greater).\n                        * Other Houses: The cumulative volume must not exceed 70 cubic meters or 15% (whichever is greater).\n                        * Absolute Limit: In all cases, the increase must not exceed 115 cubic meters.\nHeight Restrictions:\n                        * The height of the extension must not exceed the highest part of the existing roof.\n                        * For properties with a flat roof, the extension must not be taller than the height of the original dwellinghouse.\nProximity to Boundaries:\n                        * No part of the extension should be nearer to any highway than the nearest part of the original dwellinghouse unless the extension is at least 20 meters from the highway.\nDesignated Areas:\n                        * Properties in designated areas such as conservation areas, National Parks, or Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty have more restricted permitted development rights, potentially requiring formal planning permission even for smaller extensions.\nImportant Considerations:\n                        * Amendments: The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (Wales) Orders 2014 and 2019 introduce specific changes and clarifications but do not fundamentally alter the provisions related to standard extensions under Schedule 2, Part 1. The 2014 amendment refines some criteria for residential projects, while the 2019 amendment includes updates relevant to designated areas and certain types of land use.\n                        * Verification with Authorities: Due to potential nuances or recent legislative changes that could affect individual cases, consulting the local planning authority or a professional planner is crucial to confirm compliance with current regulations.","

In Wales, homeowners can typically build an extension without applying for planning permission if it falls under certain permitted classes outlined in the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Wales) Order 1995. Here are the key rules and exceptions:

1. **Permitted Classes**: Extensions may fall under Class A or B of the GPDO, which allow developments like single-storey extensions without planning permission, provided they meet specific size criteria.

2. **Size Limitations**: The size of the extension is crucial. In Wales, extensions are generally limited in terms of percentage of curtilage, with permitted development rights ceasing beyond a certain threshold.

3. **Materials**: The type of materials used (e.g., stone, brick vs. synthetic) may influence whether planning permission is required.

4. **Location and Designation**: Development on non-designated land (like greenbelt in England, but specific Welsh designations apply) typically allows permitted development.

5. **Recent Amendments**: Recent changes to the GPDO and related regulations may have altered fees or requirements, affecting when planning permission becomes necessary for certain types of extensions.

6. **Exceptions**: If the extension exceeds size limits, uses non-permitted materials, or is located on designated land, planning permission is required.

In conclusion, while large extensions may often be permitted under Welsh regulations, the need for planning permission depends on factors such as size relative to the property, construction materials, and any applicable recent amendments.","['', ' The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, Schedule 2, Part 1\r\n', ' The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (Wales) Order 2014\r\n', ' The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (Wales) Order 2019']",17,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Wales,"A parent in Wales is seeking additional learning support for their child, who has been diagnosed with special educational needs (SEN). How does the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 protect the child’s right to education, and what steps should the parent take to ensure their child receives the necessary support?","The Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 provides a strong legal framework to protect the rights of children with special educational needs (SEN) in Wales, ensuring they receive appropriate education and support. Here's how the Act safeguards these rights and the steps parents should take:\nHow the Act Protects the Child’s Right to Education\n                           * Definition of Additional Learning Needs (ALN) (Section 2): The Act defines ALN as a learning difficulty or disability that requires additional learning provision. This ensures children who face significantly greater learning challenges than their peers or have disabilities affecting their use of educational facilities are identified and supported.\n                           * Individual Development Plans (IDPs) (Section 10): The Act mandates the creation of IDPs for children with ALN. These comprehensive, tailored plans detail the specific support required and are maintained by local authorities or educational institutions, guaranteeing that each child's unique needs are met.\n                           * Duties of Local Authorities and Schools (Sections 11 and 14): Local authorities and the governing bodies of maintained schools have a duty to identify children with ALN and make appropriate provisions. They must review these provisions regularly to ensure their effectiveness and adapt them as needed.\n                           * Participation and Rights (Section 6): The Act emphasizes involving children and their parents in the decision-making process regarding ALN support. Authorities must also consider the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, reinforcing a rights-based approach.\n                           * Access to Information and Advice (Section 9): The Act requires local authorities to provide parents with information and advice on ALN and the available support, empowering them to make informed decisions.\n                           * Dispute Resolution and Appeals (Sections 68 and 70): The Act establishes clear mechanisms for resolving disagreements. If parents are unsatisfied with the IDP or support provided, they can use local dispute resolution services. Additionally, they have the right to appeal decisions to the Education Tribunal for Wales.\nSteps Parents Should Take to Ensure Their Child Receives Support\n                           * Request an Assessment: Parents can request that the local authority assess their child for ALN. Although the Act does not explicitly state this in Section 11, it mandates that authorities and schools must decide if a child has ALN when concerns are raised.\n                           * Engage in the IDP Process: Actively participate in the development and review of the IDP. Ensure the IDP reflects the child's current needs and advocate for revisions as needed.\n                           * Utilize Available Resources: Make use of the information and advice provided by local authorities as mandated in Section 9. This will help parents understand their rights and the provisions their child is entitled to.\n                           * Address Disagreements: If there are concerns about the IDP or the support provided, use the dispute resolution mechanisms outlined in Section 68. For unresolved issues, parents can appeal to the Education Tribunal for Wales as outlined in Section 70.\n                           * Regularly Review the IDP: Ensure that the IDP is reviewed regularly, as mandated by the Act, to keep it aligned with the child’s evolving educational needs.\nThis framework ensures that children with SEN in Wales receive the educational support they require, and parents are empowered to advocate effectively for their child’s rights.","

**How the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 Protects Children with SEN and What Steps a Parent Should Take**

**1. Understanding the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018:**
   - The **Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018** replaces previous legislation and aims to streamline the process for identifying, assessing, and supporting children with Special Educational Needs (SEN) in Wales.
   - Key objectives include ensuring that every child with SEN is identified and supported through appropriate provision, such as tailored teaching methods or additional resources.

**2. How the Act Protects a Child’s Right to Education:**
   - **Identification and Assessment:** The act requires local authorities to identify children with SEN and assess their needs promptly.
   - **Individual Development Plan (IDP):** An IDP is created for each child with SEN, outlining their learning goals and the support they need. This plan must be reviewed annually.
   - **Provision and Support:** Schools and local authorities are obligated to provide necessary resources or special educational arrangements, such as extra help or specific teaching strategies.

**3. Steps a Parent Should Take:**

- **1. Request an Assessment:**
   - Contact the child's school or the local authority (Education Wales) to request an assessment of SEN.
   - The parent should be involved in this process and can seek advice from organizations like the Welsh Assembly Government if needed.

- **2. Access the Individual Development Plan (IDP):**
   - Once the IDP is drafted, the parent should review it and provide feedback to ensure it meets their child's needs.
   - The school or local authority must give the parent a copy of the IDP and keep them informed about any changes.

- **3. Monitor Progress and Request Additional Support:**
   - Regularly check if the support in place is effective. If not, request an ALN (Additional Learning Notice) from the local authority to demand necessary interventions.
   - Parents can also request a review of the IDP if they believe it's insufficient.

- **4. Seek External Advice if Needed:**
   - If there are concerns about the support provided or the process followed, contact organizations like the Welsh Assembly Government for guidance or seek legal advice from educational charities.

**5. Key Points for the Parent:**
   - **Rights:** The parent has the right to be involved in their child's education and to access information about SEN support.
   - **Challenges:** Common issues include delays in assessments, insufficient support, or a lack of communication. Knowing how to navigate these can empower the parent to advocate effectively for their child.

By understanding their rights under the Act and taking proactive steps, parents can ensure that their child with SEN receives the necessary support and resources to thrive academically.","['', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 2: Definition of Additional Learning Needs (ALN)\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 6: Participation and Rights\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 9: Access to Information and Advice\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 10: Individual Development Plans (IDPs)\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 11: Duties to Decide: Maintained Schools and Further Education Institutions\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 14: Duties of Local Authorities and Schools\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 68: Dispute Resolution Mechanisms\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 70: Appeals to the Education Tribunal for Wales']",17,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Scotland,"An employee in Scotland has recently lost a child and is unsure of their entitlement to bereavement leave. Under the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018, what are their rights, and what obligations does the employer have?","Under the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018, incorporated into the Employment Rights Act 1996 and the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, employees in Scotland who have lost a child are entitled to specific rights, and employers have corresponding obligations. Section 80EA of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (as amended) grants eligible employees the right to take at least two weeks of parental bereavement leave. This leave must be taken within 56 days from the date of the child’s death and applies to the death of a child under 18. Section 80EE extends these rights to cases involving stillbirths after 24 weeks of pregnancy. Employers are obligated to provide this leave, ensuring that eligible employees can take time off without facing any detriment or dismissal related to their leave request. For statutory parental bereavement pay, Section 171ZZ6 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (as amended) outlines the entitlement, specifying that the employee must meet certain conditions such as a continuous employment period of at least 26 weeks ending with the ""relevant week"" (the week immediately before the child’s death) and minimum earnings meeting the lower earnings limit. Section 171ZZ7 adds that employees must give notice to their employer about the weeks for which they seek parental bereavement pay, and employers may require this notice in writing. Regulations under this section may also stipulate further requirements, such as providing evidence of entitlement or conditions for determining continuous employment. In addition to these primary sections, reviewing supporting regulations linked to the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018 and related guidance is essential for comprehensive compliance. Regulations detail how leave is to be taken, how statutory pay is processed, and additional procedural requirements for both employees and employers.","

**Employee Rights and Employer Obligations Under the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018 in Scotland**

**Employee Rights:**

1. **Entitlement to Paid Leave:**
   - Employees in Scotland are entitled to take up to 5 days of paid leave following the loss of a child, as per the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018. This period is primarily for grieving or arranging funeral arrangements.

2. **Protection Against Discrimination:**
   - Employers must protect their employees from unfair dismissal or retaliation related to taking this leave. The law prohibits discrimination based on age, gender reassignment, marital status, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or pregnancy.

3. **Contractual Rights:**
   - Employees may also have contractual rights through their job contract, which might offer additional benefits beyond the statutory entitlements provided by the Act.

**Employer Obligations:**

1. **Legal Compliance:**
   - Employers must comply with the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018 when handling such leave requests. They are prohibited from taking adverse actions against employees who request or take this leave.

2. **Notice Periods:**
   - If an employee intends to start their leave within 56 days of the child's death, the employer may require a shorter notice period. Otherwise, the standard 28-day annual leave notice applies.

3. **Pay Entitlement:**
   - For each day taken off, employees are entitled to either statutory pay or contractual pay, whichever is higher. Statutory pay rates are set by law.

4. **Return to Work:**
   - An employee can return to work unless it's deemed unreasonable given their circumstances. The employer must assess this based on the individual situation.

5. **Providing Information:**
   - Employers should provide clear information on how to request parental bereavement leave and what pay entitlements apply. This includes any contractual terms that supplement statutory rights.

**Practical Steps for Employees:**

- **Notification:** Inform the employer promptly about the loss of a child.
- **Leave Request:** Discuss with the employer the specific dates for the leave and whether it falls within the 56-day period.
- **Pay Calculation:** Confirm the correct pay rate, either statutory or contractual.

**Conclusion:**
Employers in Scotland have a responsibility to support their employees during a tragic event by providing adequate paid leave and protecting them from discrimination. Employees should utilize this benefit confidently, knowing they are protected by law. If uncertain about specific details, consulting with an HR professional or legal advisor can provide further clarity.","['', ' 1.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations introduce a new statutory entitlement for bereaved parents who are employees to take up to two weeks’ leave from their job called parental bereavement leave in the 56 weeks following the death of a child. These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers inserted into the Employment Rights Act 1996 (c. 18) (the “1996 Act”) by the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay Act) 2018 (c. 24).
Part 2 relates to entitlement to parental bereavement leave. The right to take parental bereavement leave is conferred by regulation 4 which sets out the conditions for entitlement which must be satisfied by the employee in order to take parental bereavement leave. These include substantive requirements, such as the employee falling within the definition of a bereaved parent (in particular, specifying the types of parental relationships in respect of which the new entitlement arises), as well as procedural requirements, such as the employee giving appropriate notices to their employer. Where an employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave under regulation 4 as the result of the death of more than one child, the employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave in respect of each child.
Regulation 5 sets out the number of weeks of parental bereavement leave that are available to a bereaved parent and gives an employee the option of taking either one or two weeks’ parental bereavement leave. The weeks taken as parental bereavement leave do not need to be taken consecutively. It also provides that parental bereavement leave may only be taken within the period of 56 weeks beginning with the date of the child’s death.
Regulation 6 details the notice requirements and other information the bereaved parent must provide to their employer before taking parental bereavement leave. An employee does not need to provide notice in writing to his or her employer, but the length of notice required to book and cancel parental bereavement leave will vary depending on whether the period the employee intends to take as parental bereavement leave falls within 56 days of the child’s death or later. Regulations 7 and 8 respectively set out when an employee’s period of bereavement leave may start and what happens when a period of parental bereavement leave is interrupted by another type of statutory leave under Part 8 of the 1996 Act.
Part 3 contains provisions applicable in relation to the taking of parental bereavement leave. Regulation 9 elaborates on the new section 80EB of the 1996 Act, by providing that an employee is entitled during his or her absence on leave to the benefit of all of his or her terms and conditions of employment apart from the right to remuneration (excluded by Section 80EB(3)(b)); also that the employee is subject to all of the obligations under those terms and conditions except in so far as they are inconsistent with the right to take parental bereavement leave (the exception appears in section 80EB(1)(b)). Regulations 10 and 11 provide for an employee’s right to return to work after taking a period of parental bereavement leave, distinguishing the case where the leave was an isolated period of absence from the case where it followed another period of statutory leave. Regulations 12 and 13 provide that an employee entitled to parental bereavement leave is protected from detriment and dismissal attributable to the fact that they took or sought to take parental bereavement leave.
Part 4 contains provisions applicable where an employee has a contractual right to parental bereavement leave, in addition to the statutory right contained within these Regulations.
These Regulations are part of a package of legislative measures and the relevant impact assessment is the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill impact assessment which was published on 14 May 2018.

Scotland,"A tenant in Scotland has reported significant dampness and mold in their rented flat to the landlord, who has not taken any action. Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, what are the landlord's obligations, and what steps can the tenant take to enforce these obligations?","Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, landlords are required to ensure that their rental properties meet the Repairing Standard, as defined in Section 13 of the Act. This includes ensuring that the property is wind and watertight, reasonably fit for human habitation, and that the structure and exterior are in a reasonable state of repair. Additionally, installations for the supply of water, gas, electricity, sanitation, heating, and hot water must be kept in proper working order. Significant dampness and mold indicate a failure to meet this standard. Under Section 14, landlords have a duty to ensure that the house meets the repairing standard at the start of the tenancy and throughout its duration. This duty requires landlords to complete any necessary repairs within a reasonable time after being notified by the tenant or otherwise becoming aware of the need for repairs. Failure to act within a reasonable timeframe constitutes a breach of this duty. If the landlord does not take action, the tenant can apply to the First-tier Tribunal under Section 22 of the Act. This section allows tenants to seek a decision from the Tribunal if the property does not meet the Repairing Standard. The Tribunal can investigate and issue a Repairing Standard Enforcement Order (RSEO) under Section 24, compelling the landlord to carry out the required repairs within a specified timeframe. If the landlord fails to comply with the RSEO, under Section 26, the Tribunal must notify the local authority and may consider imposing a rent relief order to reduce the tenant’s rent. The Tribunal may excuse non-compliance if the landlord demonstrates an inability to comply due to a lack of necessary rights (e.g., access) or if the required work poses a danger to any person. In such cases, the Tribunal must notify the local authority of its findings. The Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 provides tenants with clear mechanisms to address substandard housing conditions and enforce their rights against landlords who fail to fulfill their obligations. These regulations govern the procedures of the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland Housing and Property Chamber, which is responsible for handling cases brought under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, including applications related to the Repairing Standard. The regulations ensure that disputes between tenants and landlords are resolved fairly and efficiently. They outline the rules for submitting applications, conducting hearings, issuing decisions, and enforcing orders such as Repairing Standard Enforcement Orders (RSEOs). This procedural framework directly supports tenants in seeking remedies for landlords' failures to meet their legal obligations under the Act.","

Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties are habitable, free from dampness, and free from mold. Here's a structured overview of the situation:

1. **Landlord's Obligations**:
   - The landlord is responsible for maintaining the property in a condition that ensures it remains fit for human habitation.
   - Specifically, section 5 of the Act imposes a duty on landlords to comply with housing standards, which include ensuring against issues like dampness and mold.

2. **Tenant's Actions**:
   - If the landlord fails to address the issue, the tenant should take formal steps. The first action is to notify the landlord in writing about the problem.
   - Tenants can escalate the issue to the Scottish Housing Enforcement Panel (SHIP), which has powers to enforce housing standards and can compel landlords to remedy the situation.

3. **Enforcement Processes**:
   - The tenant may also report the matter to the local authority, such as the city council, which can inspect the property and take enforcement action if necessary.
   - Local authorities have the power to impose penalties on landlords who fail to address the issue, potentially leading to fines or other enforcement measures.

4. **Potential Compensation**:
   - The tenant may be entitled to compensation due to the unsafe living conditions caused by the landlord's inaction.

In summary, tenants in Scotland have rights under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 regarding habitable living conditions. If a landlord fails to address issues like dampness and mold, tenants can escalate the matter through various channels, including SHIP or local authorities, to enforce their legal rights.","['', ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 13: The Repairing Standard\r\n', "" Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 14: Landlord's Duty to Repair and Maintain\r\n"", ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 22: Application to the First', 'tier Tribunal\r\n', ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 24: Repairing Standard Enforcement Order (RSEO)\r\n', ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 26: Effect of Failure to Comply with Repairing Standard Enforcement Order\r\n', ' Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014\r\n', ' First', 'tier Tribunal for Scotland Housing and Property Chamber (Procedure) Regulations 2017 https://www.legislation.gov.Unitedkingdom/ssi/2017/328/contents/made']",17,True,"47

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations introduce measures to improve the energy efficiency of certain private rented property in Scotland.
The Regulations apply to domestic private rented property. They prescribe a minimum level of energy efficiency by means of the energy performance indicator included on the energy performance certificate for the property. This minimum level is set for the period from 1 October 2020 to 31 March 2022 as an energy efficiency or performance rating of E, and for the period from and after 1 April 2022 as an energy efficiency or performance rating of D. The Regulations provide that, subject to prescribed exceptions, a landlord of a domestic private rented property must not grant a new tenancy of the property after 1 October 2020, and must not continue to let the property after that date, where the energy efficiency or performance rating of the property is below the minimum level.
The Regulations make provision for the enforcement of the requirements of the Regulations by local authorities in relation to domestic private rented properties (“enforcement authority”). Landlords seeking to rely on a prescribed exemption when letting a private rented property which falls below the minimum level of energy efficiency must register that exemption on a register maintained by the local authority for their area. Where an enforcement authority considers that a landlord may be in breach of a requirement of the Regulations, it may serve a compliance notice requiring the landlord to provide evidence to the enforcement authority. Where an enforcement authority is satisfied that a landlord is in breach, it may issue a penalty notice imposing a financial penalty. The landlord may request a review of the penalty notice by the enforcement authority and, where a penalty notice is confirmed on review, may appeal against the imposition of the penalty notice to Sheriff court.","{'category': 'Exclusively or primarily applies to Scotland', 'country': 'Scotland', 'file': 'The Energy Efficiency (Domestic Private Rented Property) (Scotland) Regulations 2020.txt', 'legislation': 'Scottish Draft Statutory Instruments', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/sdsi/2020/9780111043912/note', 'year': '2020'}","Pre-action requirements for assured and short assured tenancies

Scotland,"An individual in Scotland is experiencing domestic abuse from their partner with whom they share a tenancy. They wish to remove the abuser from the home but are unsure of their rights. Under the Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021, what legal protections are available, and what steps should they take?","Individuals experiencing domestic abuse in Scotland can seek protection through several legal mechanisms. Under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, they can apply for a Non-Harassment Order, which prohibits the abuser from engaging in threatening or harassing behavior. Additionally, the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981 allows for an Exclusion Order to remove the abuser from the shared home and prevent them from re-entering. This Act applies not only to married couples but also to cohabitants. The individual should contact the police to report the abuse, as domestic abuse is a criminal offense under the Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2018, which recognizes controlling behavior as abuse. Seeking legal advice from a solicitor experienced in domestic abuse cases is advisable to assist with applications for protective orders, and engaging with support services such as Scottish Women's Aid can provide additional assistance and guidance.","

**Legal and Protective Measures for a Tenant Experiencing Domestic Abuse in Scotland**

If you are a tenant in Scotland experiencing domestic abuse and share a tenancy with your abusive partner, here are the key steps and protections available under the Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021:

1. **Seek Immediate Safety**: Your primary concern is your safety. If possible, remove yourself from the premises if it's safe to do so.

2. **Apply for a Protection Order**: You can apply for a Protection Order through your local court. This order prohibits the abuser from entering or threatening you in your home. It does not require you to leave the property but ensures your safety.

3. **Injunctions**: The court can issue an Injunction preventing the abuser from entering your home or threatening you. If you've left, this can help prevent them from returning or threatening you elsewhere.

4. **Notifying the Landlord**: Inform your landlord about the abuse. Under the DAPSA 2021, landlords are protected from issuing eviction orders based on gender or abuse status, so they cannot evict you solely because of the abuse.

5. **Ending Tenancy**: If staying is unsafe, you can end your tenancy by giving notice to your landlord. If the landlord refuses, you may need to apply for an Injunction or seek help from social services.

6. **Support Services**: Access shelters and legal aid. Contact domestic abuse helplines for assistance with safety planning and rights advocacy.

7. **Legal Advice**: Seek free or low-cost legal advice to navigate your options, including court processes and tenancy issues.

8. **Landlord's Responsibilities**: Report the landlord if they fail to take action against the abuser. Housing authorities can hold them accountable for not ensuring a safe living environment.

9. **Joint Tenants**: If you are a joint tenant, consider your legal rights to remove the abusive partner from the tenancy while ensuring they no longer have access.

**Important Considerations**:
- You do not need to leave your home unless it is unsafe.
- Evidence of abuse (e.g., police reports, photos) may be required for court applications.
- Seek support organizations for emotional and practical assistance.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision in connection with the redress scheme established by the Redress for Survivors (Historical Child Abuse in Care) (Scotland) Act 2021 (asp 15) (“the Act”).
Section 18 of the Act enables a person to apply for a redress payment if the person or, in the case of an application for a next of kin payment, the person in respect of whom the application is made was abused while a child, and resident in a relevant care setting in Scotland. The abuse (as defined in section 19 of the Act to include sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse and abuse which takes the form of neglect) must have occurred before 1 December 2004. The definition of “relevant care setting” in section 20 of the Act comprises residential institutions such as children’s homes and residential care facilities, as well as other residential placements in consequence of boarding out or fostering arrangements. Section 18 is subject to section 23 of the Act.
Section 23(1) of the Act enables the Scottish Ministers to make regulations providing that an application may not be made under section 18 if the person who carried out the abuse was of a specified description, if the abuse was carried out in circumstances of a specified description, if the person who was abused came to be resident in the relevant care setting concerned in specified circumstances, or if the person who was abused was resident in the relevant care setting concerned for a specified purpose.
These Regulations make provision under section 23 of the Act for the purpose of creating exceptions to eligibility to apply for a redress payment under section 18 of the Act.
Regulation 2 makes provision for an exception where a person was placed in a relevant care setting for the purpose of being provided with short-term respite or holiday under arrangements made between a parent or guardian of that person and another person.

Scotland,"A retailer in Scotland is considering selling alcohol below the minimum unit price due to competitive pressures. They want to know the legal implications. Under the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012, what are the retailer's obligations, and what penalties could they face for non-compliance? ","Under the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012, which amends the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, retailers in Scotland are required to sell alcohol at or above a minimum unit price (MPU) set by the Scottish Ministers. This rule applies to all licensed premises, including shops, bars, restaurants, and temporary events with occasional licenses. The minimum price condition is detailed in Schedule 3, Paragraph 6A for premises licenses and Schedule 4, Paragraph 5A for occasional licenses. Alcohol must be sold at a minimum price calculated by multiplying the MPU by the strength and volume of the alcohol. As amended by The Alcohol (Minimum Price per Unit) (Scotland) Order 2018, the current MPU is set at 65 pence per unit. Retailers must comply with this minimum price, and selling alcohol below this threshold constitutes a breach of licensing conditions. If a retailer fails to meet the minimum pricing requirement, Section 36 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 allows the licensing board to review the premises license and impose penalties as needed. Following a review, the board may suspend the license temporarily, revoke the license entirely, or modify the license conditions to enforce compliance. These penalties aim to uphold public health and ensure responsible alcohol sales.","

**Answer:**

Under the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012, Scottish retailers have a legal obligation to ensure that alcohol is not sold below the minimum unit price (MUP). Here's a structured overview of the obligations and potential penalties for non-compliance:

### **Obligations:**
1. **Compliance with MUP:** Retailers must sell alcohol at a price that does not fall below the set MUP, currently 50 pence per unit.
2. **Labeling and Pricing Transparency:** Products must be accurately labeled to reflect the correct unit price and ensure consumers are informed about the MUP.
3. **Record Keeping:** Retailers should maintain records of sales and pricing to demonstrate compliance with MUP requirements.

### **Potential Penalties:**
1. **Fines:** The Scottish government can impose penalties for each instance where the MUP is violated, leading to financial sanctions.
2. **Recovery of Shortfalls:** If a retailer sells alcohol below MUP, they may be required to reimburse the difference between the sale price and the MUP for each violation.
3. **License Suspension or Revocation:** Persistent non-compliance can lead to the suspension or revocation of the retailer's alcohol license, affecting their ability to operate legally.
4. **Civil Liability:** Customers may pursue legal action against retailers for harm caused by purchasing alcohol sold below MUP, though this is less common.

### **Considerations:**
- **Strict Liability:** The offence is likely strict liability, meaning intent is irrelevant. Retailers can face penalties even if unintentional.
- **Tiered Penalties:** Repeat offenders may face more severe consequences, including higher fines or license revocation.
- **Exceptions:** Some promotions might be exempt, but this typically applies to occasional sales rather than routine discounts.

### **Legal Enforcement:**
The Scottish government and local councils enforce MUP regulations. Retailers should consult legal professionals to navigate compliance complexities and avoid penalties. Understanding these obligations and potential consequences is crucial for maintaining lawful business practices.","['', ' Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, Schedule 3, Paragraph 6A ', ' Premises Licence Mandatory Conditions\r\n', ' Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, Schedule 4, Paragraph 5A ', ' Occasional Licence Mandatory Conditions\r\n', ' The Alcohol (Minimum Price per Unit) (Scotland) Order 2018 ', ' Minimum Unit Pricing for Alcohol in Scotland\r\n', ' Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, Section 36 ', ' Application for Review of Premises Licence:']",17,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Scotland,"A parent in Scotland believes their child requires additional support in school due to a learning difficulty. Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 (as amended), what rights does the child have, and what steps can the parent take to secure the necessary support?","Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004, as amended, children in Scotland who require additional support due to learning difficulties are legally entitled to specific rights. Education authorities have a duty to assess and provide for these needs when required. According to Section 8(1), if a parent requests an assessment to determine whether their child has additional support needs or requires a Co-ordinated Support Plan (CSP), the education authority must comply with this request unless it is deemed unreasonable. Following assessment, Section 4(1)(a) requires the education authority to make adequate and efficient provision for the identified needs, which can include specialized resources or tailored teaching approaches. If a child’s support needs involve multiple agencies, such as social work or healthcare in addition to education, Section 9(1) ensures they are entitled to a CSP, a document outlining coordinated support across agencies. Parents also have the right, under Section 12(2), to be actively involved in developing and reviewing support plans to ensure that their child’s educational requirements are fully understood and addressed. If disagreements arise regarding the support provided or decisions made, Section 18(1) grants parents the right to appeal to the Additional Support Needs Tribunal for Scotland, which can make binding rulings on disputes related to additional support. These legislative provisions provide a strong framework for ensuring children’s educational needs are met and give parents a clear process to advocate for the support their child requires.","

**Rights of a Child with Learning Difficulties in Scotland Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004**

1. **Right to an Assessment:**
   - The child is entitled to an Additional Support Needs Assessment (ASN) to identify their specific needs and the additional support required. This assessment is conducted by local authority educators or specialist teachers.

2. **Access to Support Services:**
   - Upon completion of the ASN, the child is eligible for additional support services tailored to their needs. These may include:
     - Extra help in reading, writing, or numeracy.
     - Access to specialized teaching or learning support staff.
     - Accommodations in the classroom to facilitate learning.

3. **Reasonable Adjustments:**
   - The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 outlines a duty on schools and local authorities to make reasonable adjustments to meet the needs of children with additional learning requirements. This includes providing appropriate resources and adapting teaching methods.

4. **Parental Involvement:**
   - Parents have the right to be involved in their child's education and to receive information about the ASN process, outcomes, and the support provided. They are also invited to participate in meetings and decisions regarding their child’s education.

5. **Local Authority Duty:**
   - Local authorities have a statutory duty to assess, plan, and provide additional support. This includes coordinating with schools and other service providers to ensure appropriate interventions are implemented.

**Steps a Parent Can Take to Secure Support**

1. **Request an ASN:**
   - The parent can contact the school or local authority to request an ASN for their child. This initial step is crucial as it triggers the formal process of assessing the child’s needs.

2. **Participate in the ASN Process:**
   - Parents are expected to engage with the assessment process, providing necessary information about their child's difficulties and any previous support received. Active participation ensures that the ASN accurately reflects the child’s specific needs.

3. **Advocate for Support:**
   - Once the ASN is completed, the parent should advocate for appropriate support based on the findings. This may involve discussing the need for specific interventions or accommodations with school staff and local authority officials.

4. **Seek Mediation if Needed:**
   - If there is a disagreement with the outcome of the ASN or the support provided, parents can seek mediation through the local authority. This process aims to resolve issues and ensure that the child receives the necessary assistance.

5. **Escalate to the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman (if applicable):**
   - In cases where concerns cannot be resolved locally, the parent may escalate the matter to the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman for further investigation and resolution.

6. **Understand Appeal Processes:**
   - Parents have the right to appeal decisions made by local authorities regarding additional support. The process allows for a formal review of the decision and potential reconsideration of support provisions.

By understanding these rights and taking proactive steps, parents can effectively advocate for their children's educational needs, ensuring that they receive appropriate support to meet their learning potentials.",['Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004'],17,True,"Prospective

NothernIreland,"An individual in NothernIreland is experiencing domestic abuse and seeks protection from their abuser. Under the Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (NothernIreland) 2021, what legal protections are available, and what steps should they take to secure those protections?","An individual in NothernIreland experiencing domestic abuse is protected under the Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (NothernIreland) 2021. Specifically, Section 1 of the Act criminalizes a course of abusive behaviour towards a person to whom the abuser is personally connected, such as a partner, ex-partner, or family member. The individual should report the abuse to the Police Service of NothernIreland to initiate a criminal investigation under this Act. Section 2 defines ""abusive behaviour"" as behaviour that is violent or threatening, or behaviour where a reasonable person would consider the course of behaviour likely to cause one or more of the following effects on the victim (B):
                                       * Making B dependent on, or subordinate to, A (the abuser);
                                       * Isolating B from friends, relatives, or other sources of social interaction or support;
                                       * Controlling, regulating, or monitoring B's day-to-day activities;
                                       * Depriving B of, or restricting, freedom of action;
                                       * Frightening, humiliating, degrading, or punishing B.
While the Act does not provide specific protective orders, the individual may apply for a Non-Molestation Order or an Occupation Order under the Family Homes and Domestic Violence (NothernIreland) Order 1998. A Non-Molestation Order can prohibit the abuser from molesting the applicant or a relevant child, and an Occupation Order can regulate the occupation of the shared residence. Additionally, Sections 25 to 28 of the Act offer special measures in civil proceedings to support victims, such as prohibiting the abuser from cross-examining the victim in person.
To secure these protections, the individual should:
                                       1. Report the abuse to the Police Service of NothernIreland to initiate criminal proceedings under the Act.
                                       2. Seek legal advice to apply for a Non-Molestation Order or an Occupation Order through the courts.
                                       3. Utilize the special measures provided in the Act during any civil proceedings to ensure their safety and well-being.","

The Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (Northern Ireland) 2021 provides a robust framework to protect victims of domestic abuse, offering a range of legal protections and support measures. Here's a structured overview of the available protections and steps for victims:

### Legal Protections Under the Act

1. **Types of Orders**:
   - **Peaceful Coexistence Order**: Issued when there is no actual physical violence but the abuser has caused fear, prohibiting them from certain behaviors aimed at intimidating the victim.
   - **Protection Order**: For cases involving physical violence or serious harm, imposing restrictions on the abuser and providing protection for the victim.

2. **Warrantless Searches**: Police may conduct searches without a warrant if there's reasonable belief that domestic abuse is occurring, allowing immediate intervention to protect victims.

3. **Special Measures in Civil Proceedings**: Courts can take measures such as allowing remote testimony or support persons to assist vulnerable witnesses, reducing the trauma of court appearances.

4. **Civil Claims**: Victims may pursue compensation or damages through civil proceedings if they've experienced significant harm due to domestic abuse.

5. **Enforcement and Compliance**: Orders enforced through mechanisms like regular checks or reporting obligations, with potential consequences for non-compliance, such as fines or penalties.

### Steps forVictims

1. **Report to Police**: The initial step is to report abuse to the police, which triggers an investigation and possible intervention.

2. **Seek Shelter and Support**: Victims should consider seeking safe shelter and reaching out to support organizations, which may receive funding under the Act.

3. **Apply for Protective Orders**: After reporting, victims can apply for either a Peaceful Coexistence or Protection Order through legal processes.

4. **Legal Representation**: Access to legal aid is available to assist victims in navigating court proceedings and understanding their rights.

5. **Seek Compensation**: Victims may pursue civil claims against abusers for compensation, especially in cases of severe harm.

### Additional Considerations

- **Support Services**: The Act may provide funding for support services, enhancing access to counseling and assistance.
- **Vulnerable Witness Support**: Special measures during court proceedings ensure victims' safety and well-being.

The Act offers a comprehensive approach, addressing both criminal and civil aspects of domestic abuse while providing necessary support systems for victims.","['', ' Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (NothernIreland) 2021\r\n', ' Family Homes and Domestic Violence (NothernIreland) Order 1998']",17,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

NothernIreland,"An employee in NothernIreland suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage. Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015, what are their rights, and what steps can they take to address the issue?","Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015, an employee in NothernIreland who suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage (NMW) has specific rights and actionable steps to address the issue. The Act mandates that employees must be paid at least the NMW, as set out in Section 1(1), which establishes the legal entitlement to minimum wage for all qualifying workers. Employers are legally required to keep accurate records of wage payments under Section 9 of the Act. These records should be sufficient to demonstrate that an employee is being paid at least the NMW. Therefore, the first step for the employee is to review their pay records to confirm any potential underpayment. Should there be a discrepancy, Section 10 grants the employee the right to formally request access to these records, enabling them to verify their calculations against the NMW requirement. If the employee identifies an underpayment, they should raise this issue with their employer, as it may be an oversight. If the employer fails to resolve the issue, the employee can escalate the matter to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the body responsible for enforcing compliance. While Section 13 of the Act authorizes the Secretary of State to appoint officers for enforcement purposes, Section 14 provides HMRC officers with the power to issue enforcement notices if employers are found non-compliant.  While the Act provides the primary framework, the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015 offer additional details for specific situations, such as valuing accommodation benefits or adjusting for absences, which can influence wage calculations. For most straightforward underpayment cases, the Act alone provides the necessary rights and procedures, with the Regulations supporting only in specific circumstances affecting wage calculation. In addition to these provisions, the Employment Rights (NothernIreland) Order 1996 is also relevant as it grants the employee a procedural framework for seeking redress if they are not compensated as per the NMW. Under the 1996 Order, if an employee experiences a sustained issue with underpayment, they have the right to file a claim with an Industrial Tribunal. This Order, though not specifically addressing minimum wage rates, is essential for the employee’s right to fair wages, as it permits claims for unlawful deduction of wages or breach of contract, allowing the employee to recover underpaid amounts. The 1996 Order thus complements the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 by establishing legal recourse in cases of wage disputes.","

If an employee in Northern Ireland suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage (NMW), here are their rights and steps they can take:

### **Rights Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998**

1. **Right to be Paid at Least the NMW**: Employers must pay all employees, regardless of employment type, at least the National Minimum Wage for each hour worked.

2. **Protection Against Unfair Deductions**: Employees have the right to not have their wages unlawfully deducted if they report suspected underpayment or raise concerns about minimum wage compliance.

3. **No Retaliation**: Employers are prohibited from dismissing, mistreating, or threatening employees for reporting NMW violations.

### **Steps to Address Suspected Underpayment**

1. **Verify Pay and Compare with NMW Rate**: Check your payslip to ensure your hourly rate meets the current NMW. For 2023/24, the main rates are £10.40 per hour for adults (age 16-18) and £9.20 for youth under 16.

2. **Consult employer if unsure**: If uncertain about pay, discuss with your employer to confirm you're being paid correctly.

3. **Contact the Northern Ireland Council for Trade Unions and Business (NICTU)**: This organization can provide advice and may assist in resolving issues.

4. **Report Suspected Underpayment**:
   - **Labour Relations Agency (LRA)**: Submit a report via their website or phone helpline.
   - **Business Northern Ireland**: They may assist in providing guidance or raising the issue with the employer.

5. **Document Evidence**: Keep all relevant documents, including payslips, contracts, and correspondence, to support your claim.

6. **Seek Legal Advice if Necessary**: If unresolved, contact Citizens Advice or a legal professional for assistance.

### **Important Considerations**

- **Time Limits**: Typically, issues must be reported within 6 years of discovery.
- **Employer Consequences**: Employers who underpay face penalties and may have to correct the issue, including back pay with interest.
- **Role Exceptions**: Ensure your role is covered by the Act; some jobs might have specific rules.

### **Conclusion**

Employees in Northern Ireland have clear rights regarding minimum wage. If they suspect underpayment, they should document their situation, report it formally, and seek support from relevant authorities to address the issue effectively.","['', ' National Minimum Wage Act 1998\r\n', ' National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015\r\n', ' The Employment Rights (NothernIreland) Order 1996']",17,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

These Regulations amend the National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/621) (“the 2015 Regulations”) and come into force on 1st April 2024.
Regulation 57(1) of the 2015 Regulations provides that the term “work” within those Regulations does not include any work done in relation to an employer’s family household if the requirements set out in regulation 57(2) or (3) are met. These Regulations remove regulation 57(3) of the 2015 Regulations (“paragraph (3)”). The requirements set out in paragraph (3) are all of the following—
(a)
the worker resides in the family home of the worker’s employer;
(b)
the worker is not a member of that family, but is treated as such, in particular as regards to the provision of living accommodation and meals and the sharing of tasks and leisure activities;
(c)
the worker is neither liable to any deduction, nor to make any payment to the employer, or any other person, as respects the provision of the living accommodation or meals;
(d)
if the work had been done by a member of the employer’s family, it would not be treated as work or as performed under a worker’s contract because the requirements in regulation 57(2) would be met. The requirements in regulation 57(2) are all of the following: the worker is a member of the employer’s family; the worker resides in the family home of the employer; the worker shares in the tasks and activities of the family.
Upon commencement of this instrument, any work which meets the requirements set out in paragraph (3) will be included as “work” for the purposes of the 2015 Regulations. This will mean that from 1st April 2024 a worker must be remunerated in respect of any such work in a pay reference period (as defined by regulation 6 of the 2015 Regulations) at a rate which is not less than the national minimum wage (as set out in Part 2 of the 2015 Regulations).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. Instead a de minimis assessment has been prepared as this instrument is likely to entail some costs for businesses, but the net impact is estimated to be below £5 million per year.","{'category': 'May contain legislation that applies to NothernIreland', 'country': 'NothernIreland', 'file': 'The National Minimum Wage (Amendment) Regulations 2024.txt', 'legislation': 'UK Statutory Instruments', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2024/75/note/made', 'year': '2024'}","Prospective

NothernIreland,"An employee in NothernIreland has recently lost a child and is unsure about their entitlement to bereavement leave and pay. Under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022, what are their rights, and how can they access them?","Under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022, an employee in NothernIreland who has recently lost a child is entitled to bereavement leave, and if they meet certain criteria, they may also be eligible for bereavement pay. Article 112EA(1)-(3) defines a ""bereaved parent"" as an employee who meets specified relationship conditions with the deceased child, which may include a caregiving role before the child’s death. Employees who lose a child under 18, or experience a stillbirth after 24 weeks of pregnancy, are entitled to at least two weeks of bereavement leave under Article 112EA(5). This leave can be taken either as a single two-week block or in two separate one-week periods. According to Article 112EA(6), this leave must be taken within at least 56 days (eight weeks) from the date of the child’s death, providing flexibility within that period.
If an employee loses more than one child, Article 112EA(7) entitles them to bereavement leave for each child. Article 112EB outlines rights during and after bereavement leave, specifying that employees on leave retain most employment terms and conditions (excluding remuneration). According to Article 112EB(1)(a)-(c), employees are entitled to return to their original or an equivalent job after bereavement leave. Furthermore, Article 112EB(3) provides that if bereavement leave coincides with other types of parental leave (such as maternity or paternity leave), the right to return applies across the entire period of absence.
To access bereavement leave, Article 112ED(a) requires employees to notify their employer as soon as reasonably practicable, specifying the intended dates for leave. Employers are obligated to grant this leave and cannot delay or refuse it. If the employee is also eligible for statutory bereavement pay, they must provide notice and any required documentation as directed under Articles 112ED(a) and (c).","

Under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, an employee in Northern Ireland who has recently lost a child is entitled to specific rights regarding bereavement leave and pay. Here's a structured overview of their entitlements and how to access them:

### Entitlements:
1. **Bereavement Leave:**
   - **Duration:** The act provides for up to 26 weeks of leave following the loss of a child.
   - **Payment Structure:** 
     - For the first 12 weeks, the employer must pay two-thirds of the employee's normal weekly wage.
     - After the initial 12 weeks, the leave is unpaid.

2. **Accessing Leave:**
   - **Notification:** The employee must inform their employer about the loss and their intention to take bereavement leave as soon as possible after the loss occurs.
   - **Proof of Loss:** They need to provide necessary documentation, such as a death certificate, to support their claim.

3. **Contractual Rights:**
   - Employees should check their employment contract for any additional rights beyond what is provided by law. These may offer more favorable terms, such as longer paid leave or enhanced pay rates.

4. **Employment-Related Benefits:**
   - If the employee is part of an employment-related benefit scheme, their accrued rights are protected under certain conditions, ensuring they do not exceed specific limits.

### How to Access:
- **Inform Employer:** Contact your employer's HR department to notify them of the loss and request the appropriate leave.
- **Provide Documentation:** Ensure you have all necessary proof ready when notifying your employer.
- **Check Contractual Entitlements:** Review your employment contract for any additional benefits or more favorable terms that might supplement statutory entitlements.

### Considerations:
- **Recent Loss:** Be mindful of any time limits imposed by your employer or the act, as these may affect how quickly you can access benefits.
- **Employer Policies:** Each employer's policies may vary, so it's crucial to confirm specific details with HR.

By understanding their rights and seeking guidance from their employer, employees in Northern Ireland can navigate the process of accessing bereavement leave and pay with confidence.","['', ' Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022']",17,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers inserted into the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 (N.I. 16) (the “1996 Order”) by the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 (c. 5).
The Regulations revoke and re-enact the provisions of the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023 which would otherwise cease to have effect by virtue of Article 251(1A) of the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996.
These Regulations provide for a statutory entitlement for bereaved parents who are employees to take up to two weeks’ leave from their job called parental bereavement leave in the 56 weeks following the death of a child.
Part 2 relates to entitlement to parental bereavement leave. The right to take parental bereavement leave is conferred by regulation 4 which sets out the conditions for entitlement which must be satisfied by the employee in order to take parental bereavement leave. These include substantive requirements, such as the employee falling within the definition of a bereaved parent (in particular, specifying the types of parental relationships in respect of which the new entitlement arises), as well as procedural requirements, such as the employee giving appropriate notices to their employer. Where an employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave under regulation 4 as the result of the death of more than one child, the employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave in respect of each child.
Regulation 5 sets out the number of weeks of parental bereavement leave that are available to a bereaved parent and gives an employee the option of taking either one or two weeks’ parental bereavement leave. The weeks taken as parental bereavement leave do not need to be taken consecutively. It also provides that parental bereavement leave may only be taken within the period of 56 weeks beginning with the date of the child’s death.
Regulation 6 details the notice requirements and other information the bereaved parent must provide to their employer before taking parental bereavement leave. An employee does not need to provide notice in writing to his or her employer, but the length of notice required to book and cancel parental bereavement leave will vary depending on whether the period the employee intends to take as parental bereavement leave falls within 56 days of the child’s death or later. Regulations 7 and 8 respectively set out when an employee’s period of bereavement leave may start and what happens when a period of parental bereavement leave is interrupted by another type of statutory leave under Part 9 of the 1996 Order.
Part 3 contains provisions applicable in relation to the taking of parental bereavement leave. Regulation 9 elaborates on the new Article 112EB of the 1996 Order, by providing that an employee is entitled during his or her absence on leave to the benefit of all of his or her terms and conditions of employment apart from the right to remuneration (excluded by Article 112EB(2)(b)); also that the employee is subject to all of the obligations under those terms and conditions except in so far as they are inconsistent with the right to take parental bereavement leave (the exception appears in Article 112EB(1)(b)). Regulations 10 and 11 provide for an employee’s right to return to work after taking a period of parental bereavement leave, distinguishing the case where the leave was an isolated period of absence from the case where it followed another period of statutory leave. Regulations 12 and 13 provide that an employee entitled to parental bereavement leave is protected from detriment and dismissal attributable to the fact that they took or sought to take parental bereavement leave.
Part 4 contains provisions applicable where an employee has a contractual right to parental bereavement leave, in addition to the statutory right contained within these Regulations.
Part 5 (regulations 16 to 22) contains provisions in respect of the Transitional arrangements that will ensure a continuity of entitlement between the revoked Regulations and current Regulations. This part also contains the revocation of the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023.

NothernIreland,"A tenant in NothernIreland has been served an eviction notice by their landlord, giving them four weeks to vacate the property. The tenant has lived there for two years under a periodic tenancy. Under the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, is the notice period valid, and what rights does the tenant have?","Under the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, a landlord’s notice to quit a property must meet specific statutory notice periods based on the length of the tenancy. This Act amends the Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006, particularly Article 14, to reflect updated notice requirements. For a tenant who has lived in the property for two years under a periodic tenancy, Section 11 of the 2022 Act amends Article 14 of the 2006 Order to specify that the landlord must provide at least 4 months’ notice before requiring the tenant to vacate. This 4-month period applies to tenancies that have existed for more than 12 months but not more than 3 years (as outlined in the new Article 14(1A)(b)). Because the landlord provided only four weeks’ notice, this does not satisfy the legal requirement, rendering the notice invalid. The tenant has the right to remain in the property until a valid notice to quit is served that meets the legally required notice period. Under Section 11 of the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, which amends Article 14 of the Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006, landlords are required to give a minimum 4-month notice for tenancies that have lasted more than 12 months but not more than 3 years. Because the tenant has lived in the property for two years, the landlord’s four-week notice does not meet this requirement and is therefore invalid. The tenant may choose to inform the landlord in writing that the notice is invalid due to the insufficient notice period, referencing Article 14(1), which states that a notice to quit is only valid if it complies with the minimum notice periods required by law. If the landlord proceeds with eviction attempts despite the invalid notice, the tenant may seek legal remedies. While specific injunctions or protections against harassment are not outlined within this tenancy legislation, the tenant may still seek legal assistance through broader NothernIreland housing or civil law protections to prevent an unlawful eviction and maintain peaceful possession of the property.","

Under the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, an eviction notice served by a landlord with a four-week period is invalid in most cases. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Periodic Tenancy and Notice Periods**: 
   - A periodic tenancy typically requires a minimum notice period for the tenant to vacate. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, this was six months.
   
2. **Impact of COVID-19 Modifications**:
   - The Private Tenancies (Coronavirus Modifications) Act 2020 extended the notice period to twelve weeks during an emergency period, which initially ran until May 14th, 2022.
   - This modification applies only to notices served during the emergency period.

3. **Current Notice Period**:
   - If the eviction notice was served after the emergency period ended, the required notice period reverts to six months. A four-week notice would be insufficient in this case.
   - If the notice was served within the extended emergency period (even if it has been further extended), twelve weeks is the minimum.

4. **Tenant's Rights**:
   - Tenants can challenge the notice on grounds of inadequate period or procedural errors, such as failure to follow proper eviction processes.
   - Tenants may have the right to stay until a valid notice period is served or until a court resolves the matter.

5. **Uncertainty Regarding Extensions**:
   - The possibility of further extensions by the Department means that the situation could evolve, affecting the validity of the notice in the future.

In conclusion, serving a four-week eviction notice on a tenant with a periodic tenancy is generally invalid, as it falls short of both the original six-month requirement and the temporary twelve-week modification during the emergency period. Tenants can assert their rights against such notices, seeking extensions or legal review.","['', ' Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022 ', ' Section 11\r\n', ' Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006 ', ' Article 14']",17,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

As many of the economic support packages such as the Furlough scheme are due to wind down in the autumn, there is potential for a rise in unemployment which may impact private renters’ income streams and place them at increased risk of losing their homes.
These Regulations protect tenants from eviction for a reasonable and specified period of time and provide that landlords must give their tenants at least 12 weeks’ notice to quit a dwelling house let under a private tenancy.","{'category': 'Exclusively or primarily applies to NothernIreland', 'country': 'NothernIreland', 'file': 'The Private Tenancies (Coronavirus Modifications) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2020.txt', 'legislation': 'Northern Ireland Statutory Rules', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/2020/192/note/made', 'year': '2020'}","Prospective

NothernIreland,"An individual in NothernIreland is being harassed and stalked by an ex-partner, causing them significant distress. Under the Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022, what legal protections are available to them, and what steps should they take to ensure their safety?","Under the Protection from Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022, individuals in NothernIreland who are being harassed and stalked by an ex-partner can rely on specific legal protections. The Act clearly defines stalking as a criminal offense in Section 1, where engaging in a course of conduct causing another person to experience fear, alarm, or substantial distress constitutes stalking. Such conduct includes following, contacting, monitoring usage of electronic communications, and other invasive behaviors. Offenders can face severe penalties, with up to 10 years imprisonment or a fine upon conviction on indictment, or up to 12 months imprisonment or a statutory maximum fine upon summary conviction. Additionally, the Act allows for Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs), detailed in Section 7, which the Chief Constable can apply for. These orders are designed to prevent further stalking activities by imposing specific prohibitions or requirements on the stalker. The eligibility for an SPO is based on evidence that the individual has engaged in stalking, poses a risk related to stalking, and that the order is necessary to protect someone from this risk. These orders can be applied against anyone residing in, or intending to visit, NothernIreland. The duration of these orders is addressed in Section 9, where an SPO can last for a minimum of two years or until further court order. The court may specify that some conditions within the SPO remain effective until further judicial review while setting others for fixed periods. This flexibility allows the protective measures to be adapted over time to match the needs of the situation. For their safety, affected individuals should report stalking incidents to the Police Service of NothernIreland (PSNI), enabling legal proceedings that could include the issuance of an SPO. Consulting legal advice and engaging with support services are also advisable steps to ensure comprehensive protection and support.","

**Legal Protections and Steps for an Individual in Northern Ireland Experiencing Harassment and Stalking by an Ex-Partner**

**1. Legal Protections Under the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022:**
   - **Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs):** These orders can be applied ex parte, meaning they can be obtained without the presence of the alleged stalker. They are civil orders intended to protect individuals from further stalking behavior.
   - **Police Involvement:** The police can apply for these orders on behalf of the victim. Once an SPO is granted, the police have powers to enforce it.

**2. Related Legislation:**
   - **Protection from Harassment Act 1997:** This act covers various harassment-related offenses, including stalking, and allows victims to report incidents to the police.
   - **Criminal Legal Aid (General) Regulations 2020:** Provides legal aid for individuals involved in proceedings under the Stalking Protection Act, covering costs related to legal representation.

**3. Steps to Take:**
   - **Seek Immediate Help:** Contact organizations like Women and Girls Network NI or Shelter NI for guidance on safety planning and legal options.
   - **Report Incidents:** Report harassment and stalking behavior to the police. This can lead to a formal investigation and potential application for a Stalking Protection Order.
   - **Apply for Stalking Protection Orders:** The individual can apply for SPOs, which allow early intervention by the police to prevent escalation of behavior.
   - **Legal Advice:** Engage with legal aid services or specialized domestic abuse organizations for advice on how to proceed with applications and enforcement.

**4. Safety Measures:**
   - **Secure Living Environment:** Take steps to enhance home security and consider changing phone numbers to limit contact from the abuser.
   - **Domestic Violence Prevention Orders:** Explore these if available, which can provide additional protection against harassment.

**5. Support and Emotional Assistance:**
   - Utilize support groups or counseling services to address the emotional impact of harassment and stalking. Organizations like Women and Girls Network NI offer both practical advice and emotional support.

By understanding their rights and taking proactive steps, individuals can safeguard themselves and seek justice while receiving necessary support and assistance.","['', ' Protection from Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022']",17,True,"Meaning of act associated with stalking and risk associated with stalking
