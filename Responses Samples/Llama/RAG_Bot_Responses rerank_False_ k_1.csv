Unitedkingdom,"An employee in England is currently on maternity leave under the Employment Rights Act 1996. During her leave, her employer announces a redundancy process due to company restructuring. Additionally, there are health and safety concerns at the workplace that might affect her return. Considering the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (as amended), the Equality Act 2010, the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, and relevant case law, what protections does she have during redundancy, and how should the employer proceed?","Under the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999, specifically Regulation 10, if an employee on maternity leave is at risk of redundancy, she must be offered any suitable alternative vacancy available before it is offered to other employees, giving her priority for redeployment opportunities. The Equality Act 2010, particularly Section 18, prohibits discrimination because of pregnancy or maternity, requiring employers to ensure that redundancy selection criteria do not disadvantage employees on maternity leave to avoid unlawful discrimination claims. Regarding health and safety, the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, Regulation 16, mandates employers to perform a specific risk assessment for new or expectant mothers, and if risks are identified and cannot be avoided, the employer must adjust her working conditions or hours, offer suitable alternative work on no less favorable terms, or if no alternative is available, suspend her on full pay. Relevant case law, such as Sefton Borough Council v Wainwright [2014] EWCA Civ 953, confirms the obligation to offer suitable alternative employment to employees on maternity leave before others. Therefore, the employer must conduct a fair and non-discriminatory redundancy process, prioritize the employee for any suitable alternative positions, and address health and safety concerns by performing risk assessments and taking necessary actions to protect the employee.","I'll provide a comprehensive response to your question based on the given contexts.

The employee in England who is currently on maternity leave under the Employment Rights Act 1996 is entitled to various protections during the redundancy process announced by her employer due to company restructuring. Here's an analysis of the relevant laws and regulations:

1. **Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations 2020 (Superseded by 2020 No. 249)**: Although these regulations are superseded, the underlying principle that protects employees from detriment during maternity leave remains in force. Section 47C(1) of the 1996 Act prohibits employers from subjecting employees to any detriment due to their taking or seeking parental bereavement leave.

2. **Equality Act 2010**: This act protects pregnant women and new mothers from employment-related discrimination, including unfair dismissal. The Equality Act 2010 states that an employer cannot treat a pregnant woman less favorably than others in the same circumstances.

3. **Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (as amended)**: These regulations provide entitlements for employees on maternity leave, including protection from detriment during this period. The regulations also ensure that employers do not make any adverse decisions about an employee's employment solely because they are pregnant or have recently given birth.

4. **Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999**: These regulations require employers to maintain a safe working environment and provide adequate health and safety training for employees. In the event of health and safety concerns, employers must take reasonable steps to address these issues without unfairly affecting the employee's employment.

Considering these laws, the employee has the following protections during redundancy:

* Protection from detriment (as per Section 47C(1) of the 1996 Act): The employer cannot subject her to any adverse action due to her maternity leave or because she is likely to take parental bereavement leave.
* Protection under the Equality Act 2010: The employer must not treat her less favorably than others in the same circumstances, including unfair dismissal.

Regarding how the employer should proceed:

1. **Notify the employee of the redundancy process**: The employer should inform the employee about the redundancy process and provide her with the necessary information, such as notice periods, severance pay, or outplacement assistance.
2. **Avoid discriminatory actions**: The employer must ensure that any actions related to the redundancy process are fair, reasonable, and not influenced by the employee's pregnancy or maternity leave.
3. **Address health and safety concerns**: The employer should take immediate action to address the health and safety concerns at the workplace, ensuring a safe working environment for all employees.
4. **Consult with the employee about return to work**: After addressing health and safety concerns, the employer should consult with the employee about her possible return to work, taking into account any reasonable adjustments required due to her pregnancy or maternity leave.

By following these guidelines, the employer can ensure a fair and respectful process for the employee during the redundancy process while also prioritizing her safety and well-being.","['', ' Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999, Regulation 10\r\n', ' Equality Act 2010, Section 18\r\n', ' Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, Regulation 16']",1,False,"Protection from detriment

Unitedkingdom,"A tenant in England reports a malfunctioning carbon monoxide alarm installed under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (Amendment) Regulations 2022. Despite notifying the landlord, the alarm has not been repaired or replaced after three weeks. The tenant is concerned about safety and compliance. Under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm Regulations 2015 (as amended), what are the landlord's legal obligations, and what actions can the tenant take?","Under Regulation 6 of the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015, when a landlord is served with a remedial notice for breaching one or more duties outlined in Regulation 4(1) (such as failing to install or maintain smoke or carbon monoxide alarms), the landlord must take the specified remedial actions within the timeframe set out in Regulation 5(2)(d), typically 28 days from the notice's issuance. This regulation imposes a clear duty on the landlord to address the breach promptly and ensures tenant safety through enforcement mechanisms. However, Regulation 6(2) provides that a landlord will not be considered in breach of this obligation if they can demonstrate that they have taken all reasonable steps, short of initiating legal proceedings, to comply with the duty. Reasonable steps may include hiring contractors, arranging access to the property, or documenting efforts to resolve tenant-related barriers to compliance. Proper evidence of these steps is crucial to establish the landlord’s diligence. This provision ensures that while landlords are held accountable, genuine efforts to comply are recognized, even if the issue remains unresolved due to circumstances beyond their control.","Given the context of the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm Regulations 2015 (as amended) in England, under the Private Tenancies (England) Act 1997, a landlord is required to ensure that a dwelling-house has working smoke alarms installed.

Regulation 3(1)(b) of the regulations states that a landlord must ""provide"" a working smoke alarm in every room where cooking takes place, and in some rooms where hot food is prepared or heated, such as garages. This regulation applies to both smoke and carbon monoxide alarms.

In this scenario, since the tenant has reported the malfunctioning carbon monoxide alarm and it has not been repaired or replaced after three weeks, the landlord's obligations under the regulations have not been met. The landlord is required to take immediate action to repair or replace the alarm to ensure it is working correctly.

The tenant can take the following actions:

1. Serve a notice: The tenant can serve a statutory notice on the landlord, which requires the landlord to make repairs within a specified timeframe (usually two weeks).
2. Contact Citizens Advice: If the tenant is unsure about how to proceed or needs assistance with serving a notice, they can contact Citizens Advice for guidance.
3. Seek support from local authorities: The tenant may also want to inform the local authority of the situation and seek their assistance in resolving the issue.

It is worth noting that if the landlord has failed to comply with the regulations, the tenant may be entitled to compensation or other remedies under the law.","['', ' Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015 – Regulation 6: Duty of Relevant Landlord to Comply with a Remedial Notice\r\n', ' Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015 – Regulation 4: Duties of Landlords\r\n', ' Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015 – Regulation 5: Remedial Notices']",1,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Unitedkingdom,"An apprentice in England has turned 19 and has completed the first year of their apprenticeship. However, they are still being paid the apprenticeship wage, which is lower than the National Minimum Wage for their age. Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 (as amended) and the National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015, what are the apprentice's rights regarding wages, and what steps can they take if their employer is not compliant?","An apprentice in England has turned 19 and has completed the first year of their apprenticeship.

Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 (as amended) and the National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015, what are the apprentice's rights regarding wages, and what steps can they take if their employer is not compliant?","I'll provide a detailed response to your question.

Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 (as amended) and the National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015, an apprentice in England who has turned 19 and completed one year of their apprenticeship is entitled to receive the higher rate of the national minimum wage applicable to their age group. 

As per Regulation 2(3)(b) of the amendments, workers aged 18 or over (but not yet 21) should be paid £7.49 per hour, which is higher than the apprentice's current wage. However, since the apprentice has completed one year of their apprenticeship, they would actually fall under the category of workers aged 23 or over (as per Regulation 2(3)(a)), who are entitled to receive £10.42 per hour.

Therefore, the apprentice's rights regarding wages are to be paid at the higher rate applicable to their age group, which is £10.42 per hour. If the employer is not complying with this requirement, the apprentice can take the following steps:

1. **Write to the employer**: The apprentice should write to the employer explaining that they believe they are entitled to receive the higher rate of the national minimum wage due to their age and completion of apprenticeship. The letter should mention specific regulations and provide evidence of age and completion of apprenticeship.

2. **Seek support from the National Minimum Wage Helpline**: The apprentice can contact the National Minimum Wage Helpline (0800 604 602) for guidance on their rights and potential options for resolving the issue with their employer.

3. **Report to the relevant authorities**: If the employer fails to comply, the apprentice should report the matter to the relevant authorities such as the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) or HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC).

4. **Consider legal action**: As a last resort, if the employer continues to deny the apprentice's right to receive higher pay, they may consider seeking advice from a trade union representative or an employment law specialist.

It is essential for the apprentice to keep detailed records of their age, completion of apprenticeship, and any correspondence with the employer. These records can be crucial in supporting their claim and demonstrating compliance with national minimum wage regulations.","['', ' National Minimum Wage Act 1998:\r\n', ' Employment Rights Act 1996, Section 13:\r\n', ' National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015, Regulation 5(1)']",1,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Unitedkingdom,"Residents in an English town are concerned that their local authority has not implemented separate food waste collections, as required by the Environment Act 2021. The deadline has passed, and there is no plan in place. What legal obligations does the local authority have under the Act, and what legal remedies are available to the residents to enforce compliance?","Under the Environment Act 2021, specifically Section 57, which inserts Section 45AZB into the Environmental Protection Act 1990, local authorities in England are legally obligated to arrange for the separate collection of food waste from households; failure to do so constitutes a breach of statutory duty. Residents can raise the issue with the local authority by submitting formal complaints requesting compliance, engage with local councillors and Members of Parliament (MPs) to advocate for action, and may have standing to apply for a judicial review of the local authority's failure to comply with statutory duties, as established in cases like R (on the application of Greenpeace Ltd) v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1998] Env LR 415; they must act promptly and within three months of the grounds arising.","I'll provide an analysis of the situation based on the provided context.

The Environment Act 2021 sets a long-term target for reducing residual waste in England, with a specific deadline of 31st December 2042. The target is set at a maximum of 287 kilograms of residual waste per head of population. Regulation 2 of the Environmental Targets (Residual Waste) (England) Regulations 2022 requires local authorities to implement measures to reduce residual waste.

Regarding the specific obligation of the local authority, it appears that they have failed to implement separate food waste collections as required by the Act. Under section 1 of the Environment Act 2021, local authorities are responsible for ensuring that waste is managed in accordance with environmental standards.

The Regulations also provide that ""the Secretary of State must make arrangements for...the implementation"" of the target (Regulation 2). However, this regulation does not explicitly state the consequences for non-compliance. Nevertheless, as a general principle, under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, local authorities have a duty to maintain the quality of the environment and take steps to prevent pollution.

In terms of enforcement, residents can seek remedies through various channels:

Firstly, they may submit an appeal to the local authority, providing evidence that the required separate food waste collection has not been implemented. The local authority must respond to this appeal within a reasonable timeframe, as per section 33 of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

Secondly, residents can request information from the local authority regarding their implementation plans for reducing residual waste, including food waste, under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. This act allows residents to access publicly held information about a subject's decisions and actions that are intended to be accessible to the public.

Lastly, if the situation persists, residents may consider seeking judicial review under the Administrative Justice and Executive Councils (Reform) Act 2020 or other relevant legislation. However, this would require demonstrating the existence of an error of law or an improper exercise of powers by the local authority, which can be a challenging and costly process.

It's worth noting that the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying these Regulations suggests that a full impact assessment of the effects on businesses and sectors is available from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. This could provide valuable insight into potential support or guidance available to residents who are seeking compliance with the Act.

In summary, UK residents can seek remedies through appeal processes, information requests under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, and potentially judicial review if the situation persists.","['', ' Environment Act 2021, Section 57 (inserting Section 45AZB into the Environmental Protection Act 1990)\r\n', ' Environmental Protection Act 1990, Section 45AZB (as inserted by the Environment Act 2021)']",1,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Wales,"An employee lives in Wales but works in England. They are planning to take Shared Parental Leave (SPL) following the birth of their child. They are unsure how the differences between Welsh and English regulations might affect their entitlement and whether their residence in Wales impacts their rights. Under the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, what are their rights, and does their place of residence affect their entitlement? ","Under the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, which are authorized by the Employment Rights Act 1996, an employee's entitlement to Shared Parental Leave (SPL) is determined by their employment status and specific eligibility criteria, irrespective of their place of residence. The regulations apply uniformly across England and Wales. To qualify for SPL, the employee must have been continuously employed by the same employer for at least 26 weeks by the end of the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth and remain employed at the start of each period of SPL taken. Additionally, their partner must have worked (employed or self-employed) for at least 26 of the 66 weeks before the expected week of childbirth and have earned an average of at least £30 per week in 13 of those weeks. These criteria are outlined in the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, specifically in Part 2, Chapter 1, Regulation 6. Therefore, an employee residing in Wales and working in England is entitled to SPL, provided they meet these eligibility requirements, with their place of residence having no impact on their entitlement.","Let's break down the employee's situation and explore their rights under the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014.

Firstly, it's essential to understand that these regulations apply in both Wales and England. As an employee living in Wales but working in England, your residence in Wales does impact your entitlement to Shared Parental Leave (SPL).

Under regulation 20 of the Shared Parental Leave and Paternity and Adoption Leave (Adoptions from Overseas) Regulations 2014, as amended by The Maternity Leave, Adoption Leave and Shared Parental Leave (Amendment) Regulations 2024, employees are entitled to SPL if they meet the qualifying conditions.

To be eligible for SPL, you must have been employed under a contract of service for at least 52 weeks within a period of four consecutive years prior to the start of the leave. Additionally, your partner (or adoptive parent) must also meet the qualifying conditions.

Now, regarding the employee's residence in Wales: according to the regulations, the relevant day referred to in paragraph (1A)(c) is the day after a period of 18 months beginning with the day on which the child enters Great Britain. This means that the employee's 18-month qualifying period will be calculated from the date their child enters Great Britain, not from their date of birth.

In this scenario, since the child has entered Great Britain (in this case, England), the employee's 18-month qualifying period begins. As a result, the employee is eligible for SPL and can take leave following the birth of their child, subject to meeting the other conditions outlined in the regulations.

It's worth noting that while the employee's residence in Wales does impact their entitlement to SPL, it does not affect the overall structure or principles of the regulation. The amendments made by The Maternity Leave, Adoption Leave and Shared Parental Leave (Amendment) Regulations 2024 primarily modify the existing regulations to provide greater support for adoptive parents.

In summary, as an employee living in Wales but working in England, you are eligible for SPL if you meet the qualifying conditions. Your residence in Wales does not affect your entitlement to SPL, and your leave will be calculated from the date your child enters Great Britain, following a period of 18 months.","['', ' Employment Rights Act 1996:\r\n', ' Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014']",1,False,"Amendment of the Shared Parental Leave and Paternity and Adoption Leave (Adoptions from Overseas) Regulations 2014

Wales,"A tenant in Wales is experiencing severe damp and mold in their rented property, which the landlord has failed to address despite repeated requests. Under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, what are the landlord's obligations regarding repairs and safety, and what actions can the tenant take to enforce these obligations?","Under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, landlords are obligated to maintain rental properties in a condition fit for human habitation. Specifically, Section 91 mandates that landlords must ensure the dwelling is fit for human habitation both at the start and throughout the duration of the tenancy. Section 92 requires landlords to keep in repair the structure and exterior of the dwelling, including drains, gutters, and external pipes, and to maintain installations for the supply of water, gas, electricity, sanitation, space heating, and heating water. If a landlord fails to address severe damp and mold despite repeated requests, the tenant should notify the landlord in writing, keeping records of all communications. If the landlord remains unresponsive, the tenant can contact the local authority's Environmental Health department, which can inspect the property and issue improvement notices. Additionally, the tenant may apply to the court for an order requiring the landlord to carry out repairs. It's advisable to seek legal advice before considering actions like withholding rent or arranging for repairs independently, as these carry legal risks.","Under the Renting Homes (Supplementary Provisions) (Wales) Regulations 2022, which commenced on December 1, 2022, landlords in Wales have a responsibility to maintain the health, safety, and cleanliness of the rental property.

Given the severe damp and mold issue in the tenant's property, it is clear that the landlord has breached their obligations under the regulations. The contract-holder (tenant) must notify the landlord as soon as reasonably practicable of any fault, defect, damage, or disrepair they believe is the landlord's responsibility.

In this case, the tenant has already done so by reporting the issue to the landlord despite repeated requests for action. However, if the landlord fails to address the issue, the contract-holder must take further steps.

According to Regulation 14(2) of the Renting Homes (Supplementary Provisions) (Wales) Regulations 2022, the tenant is required to carry out repairs or replace items listed in any inventory within a reasonable period of time. Since the issue is with fixtures and fittings (i.e., the damp and mold itself), the tenant may be able to make their own reasonable attempts to rectify the situation.

Furthermore, under Section 96(3) of the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, ""lack of care"" is defined as an act or omission that falls short of what a reasonable person would do in similar circumstances. Given the landlord's repeated failure to address the issue despite tenant requests, it can be argued that they have shown a lack of care.

Therefore, the tenant may seek a court order requiring the landlord to carry out repairs or take other necessary steps to rectify the damp and mold issue. The tenant should also document all correspondence with the landlord, including dates, times, and details of conversations or requests for action.

To enforce these obligations, the tenant can:

1. Send a formal letter or email to the landlord reiterating their concerns and requesting a plan of action.
2. Make reasonable attempts to repair or mitigate the damp and mold issue, such as using fans, cleaning materials, or temporary fixes (if safe to do so).
3. Seek assistance from local authorities, housing associations, or tenant organizations if the landlord continues to neglect their responsibilities.

It's essential for the tenant to keep detailed records of all correspondence with the landlord and any attempts made to address the issue before seeking further action. The tenant should also be aware that they may need to provide evidence, such as photos, witness statements, or expert reports, to support their claim.","['', "" Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, Section 91: Landlord's obligation: fitness for human habitation\r\n"", "" Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, Section 92: Landlord's obligation to keep dwelling in repair""]",1,False,"Repairs

The Act defines the minimum price using the formula M × S × V, where M is the minimum unit price (set at 50p), S is the percentage strength of the alcohol, and V is the volume in litres. Non-compliance can result in enforcement actions by local authorities, including the issuance of fixed penalty notices of £200 for each offence. Therefore, retailers must adhere to the minimum pricing regulations, as discounts and promotions do not permit selling alcohol below the established minimum price.","Under the Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018, the minimum unit price of alcohol in Wales is set at £43 per litre. This means that any alcoholic beverage sold in Wales must have a minimum unit price of no less than £43.

The Act stipulates that this minimum unit price applies to all licensed premises and retailers selling alcohol for off-premises consumption. It also includes exceptions for certain types of alcohol, such as spirits with a minimum unit price set by the Licensing Board.

In terms of penalties for non-compliance, the Retail Sales of Alcohol (Minimum Unit Price) Regulations 2018 impose fines on retailers who fail to meet the minimum unit price requirement. The regulations state that a fine not exceeding £2,500 may be imposed on an individual or partnership for each day the sale of alcohol below the minimum unit price continues.

Additionally, local authorities in Wales have the power to take enforcement action against retailers who breach the Act, including issuing enforcement notices and imposing penalties. It's worth noting that the regulations also allow for prosecution under the Trade Marks Act 1994 and the Licensing (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Wales) Order 2010.

Furthermore, the Welsh Government has the power to make amendments to the minimum unit price schedule through the Retail Sales of Alcohol (Minimum Unit Price) Regulations. These regulations can be revised or revoked, but any changes must be made in accordance with the Act and the regulations.

In light of this information, if a retailer in Wales is found selling alcohol below the minimum unit price set by the Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018, they could face fines ranging from £2,500 to £25,000 per day of non-compliance. The retailer may also be subject to enforcement action by local authorities, including the issue of enforcement notices and prosecution under relevant legislation.","['', ' Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018']",1,False,"This Statutory Instrument corrects an error made by S.I. 2021/1342 (W. 346) and is being issued free of charge to all known recipients of that Statutory Instrument.

Wales,"A homeowner in Wales wants to build a large extension to their property without applying for planning permission, arguing that it's within permitted development rights. Under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Wales) Order 1995 and recent amendments, what are the rules regarding extensions, and when is planning permission required?","Under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Wales) Order 1995, as amended, specific conditions allow certain extensions to be built without a formal planning application, known as permitted development rights. Below are the key provisions relevant to the homeowner’s question:\nRelevant Provisions for Extensions:\nVolume Limitations:\n                        * Terraced Houses or Properties on Article 1(5) Land: The cumulative volume of the extension must not exceed the volume of the original dwellinghouse by more than 50 cubic meters or 10% (whichever is greater).\n                        * Other Houses: The cumulative volume must not exceed 70 cubic meters or 15% (whichever is greater).\n                        * Absolute Limit: In all cases, the increase must not exceed 115 cubic meters.\nHeight Restrictions:\n                        * The height of the extension must not exceed the highest part of the existing roof.\n                        * For properties with a flat roof, the extension must not be taller than the height of the original dwellinghouse.\nProximity to Boundaries:\n                        * No part of the extension should be nearer to any highway than the nearest part of the original dwellinghouse unless the extension is at least 20 meters from the highway.\nDesignated Areas:\n                        * Properties in designated areas such as conservation areas, National Parks, or Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty have more restricted permitted development rights, potentially requiring formal planning permission even for smaller extensions.\nImportant Considerations:\n                        * Amendments: The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (Wales) Orders 2014 and 2019 introduce specific changes and clarifications but do not fundamentally alter the provisions related to standard extensions under Schedule 2, Part 1. The 2014 amendment refines some criteria for residential projects, while the 2019 amendment includes updates relevant to designated areas and certain types of land use.\n                        * Verification with Authorities: Due to potential nuances or recent legislative changes that could affect individual cases, consulting the local planning authority or a professional planner is crucial to confirm compliance with current regulations.","In Wales, under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (No. 2) (Wales) Order 2020, certain development rights have been amended to permit changes of use for public health emergency purposes.

The key provision here is Article 3 of the GPDO, which grants permitted development rights in respect of certain developments, including the change of use of a building or land to Class C2 (Residential institutions) or Class D1 (Non-residential institutions). The Welsh Ministers' Code of Practice on Regulatory Impact Assessments considered this amendment, and as a result, it was not necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment on the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.

However, there are conditions and limitations to the permitted development. Specifically, Part 3A of Schedule 2 to the GPDO permits the change of use of a building or land for Class C2 (Residential institutions) or Class D1 (Non-residential institutions), as well as the provision of buildings or other structures.

Regarding your homeowner's proposal to build an extension without applying for planning permission, it is crucial to understand that this Order does not automatically exempt all extensions from the need for planning permission. The rules regarding extensions are more nuanced.

In Wales, under the GPDO, certain development rights have been granted to permit development in respect of changes of use or provision of buildings or other structures. However, the specific definition of ""extension"" is not explicitly defined within this Order.

The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (No. 2) (Wales) Order 2020 primarily focuses on changes of use or provision of buildings or other structures for public health emergency purposes. It does not specifically cover extensions to existing dwellings, which may be considered as a different type of development.

In light of this, it is uncertain whether the homeowner's proposal would fall under the permitted development rights granted by the Order. To determine this, an application would likely need to be made to the local planning authority (LPA) for permission, taking into account any relevant planning policies and policies within Schedule 2 to the GPDO.

In summary, while the recent amendments to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (No. 2) (Wales) Order 2020 grant permitted development rights in respect of certain changes of use or provision of buildings or other structures, it is essential to note that extensions to existing dwellings may not automatically be exempt from the need for planning permission.","['', ' The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, Schedule 2, Part 1\r\n', ' The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (Wales) Order 2014\r\n', ' The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (Wales) Order 2019']",1,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Wales,"A parent in Wales is seeking additional learning support for their child, who has been diagnosed with special educational needs (SEN). How does the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 protect the child’s right to education, and what steps should the parent take to ensure their child receives the necessary support?","The Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 provides a strong legal framework to protect the rights of children with special educational needs (SEN) in Wales, ensuring they receive appropriate education and support. Here's how the Act safeguards these rights and the steps parents should take:\nHow the Act Protects the Child’s Right to Education\n                           * Definition of Additional Learning Needs (ALN) (Section 2): The Act defines ALN as a learning difficulty or disability that requires additional learning provision. This ensures children who face significantly greater learning challenges than their peers or have disabilities affecting their use of educational facilities are identified and supported.\n                           * Individual Development Plans (IDPs) (Section 10): The Act mandates the creation of IDPs for children with ALN. These comprehensive, tailored plans detail the specific support required and are maintained by local authorities or educational institutions, guaranteeing that each child's unique needs are met.\n                           * Duties of Local Authorities and Schools (Sections 11 and 14): Local authorities and the governing bodies of maintained schools have a duty to identify children with ALN and make appropriate provisions. They must review these provisions regularly to ensure their effectiveness and adapt them as needed.\n                           * Participation and Rights (Section 6): The Act emphasizes involving children and their parents in the decision-making process regarding ALN support. Authorities must also consider the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, reinforcing a rights-based approach.\n                           * Access to Information and Advice (Section 9): The Act requires local authorities to provide parents with information and advice on ALN and the available support, empowering them to make informed decisions.\n                           * Dispute Resolution and Appeals (Sections 68 and 70): The Act establishes clear mechanisms for resolving disagreements. If parents are unsatisfied with the IDP or support provided, they can use local dispute resolution services. Additionally, they have the right to appeal decisions to the Education Tribunal for Wales.\nSteps Parents Should Take to Ensure Their Child Receives Support\n                           * Request an Assessment: Parents can request that the local authority assess their child for ALN. Although the Act does not explicitly state this in Section 11, it mandates that authorities and schools must decide if a child has ALN when concerns are raised.\n                           * Engage in the IDP Process: Actively participate in the development and review of the IDP. Ensure the IDP reflects the child's current needs and advocate for revisions as needed.\n                           * Utilize Available Resources: Make use of the information and advice provided by local authorities as mandated in Section 9. This will help parents understand their rights and the provisions their child is entitled to.\n                           * Address Disagreements: If there are concerns about the IDP or the support provided, use the dispute resolution mechanisms outlined in Section 68. For unresolved issues, parents can appeal to the Education Tribunal for Wales as outlined in Section 70.\n                           * Regularly Review the IDP: Ensure that the IDP is reviewed regularly, as mandated by the Act, to keep it aligned with the child’s evolving educational needs.\nThis framework ensures that children with SEN in Wales receive the educational support they require, and parents are empowered to advocate effectively for their child’s rights.","In Wales, the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 provides a statutory framework for supporting children and young people with additional learning needs. This Act is designed to protect the rights of children with SEN by ensuring they receive high-quality education that meets their individual needs.

One of the key ways this Act protects the child's right to education is by introducing the concept of ""Education, Health and Care (EHC) Plans."" These plans are tailored to each child's specific needs and outline the support they require to access the curriculum. The EHC Plan must be developed in partnership with the child, their parents, and relevant professionals, ensuring that everyone is involved in making decisions about the child's education.

Additionally, the Act establishes a statutory entitlement for children with SEN to receive high-quality education that meets their individual needs. This means that schools are required to provide suitable provision to support these children, which can include additional resources, specialized teaching, or adaptations to the learning environment.

When seeking additional learning support for their child, a parent in Wales should take the following steps:

1. **Work with the school**: Collaborate with the child's teachers and the school to identify areas where additional support is needed.
2. **Request an Education, Health and Care (EHC) assessment**: If the school has not already done so, request an EHC assessment to determine the child's specific needs and develop a personalized plan.
3. **Prepare an EHC Plan**: Work with the local authority and relevant professionals to create an EHC Plan that outlines the support required for the child's education.
4. **Seek mediation (if necessary)**: If there is disagreement about the EHC Plan or the provision, parents can seek mediation through the Tribunal.
5. **Appeal if necessary**: If a parent is dissatisfied with the outcome of the process, they can appeal to the Tribunal.
6. **Advocate for their child's rights**: Familiarize yourself with your child's rights under the Act and advocate for them throughout the process.

It is essential to remember that as a parent in Wales, you have the right to be involved in the decision-making process about your child's education and the provision of additional support. By working collaboratively with schools, local authorities, and relevant professionals, you can ensure your child receives the necessary support to access high-quality education.

In summary, the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 provides a framework for supporting children with SEN in Wales, protecting their right to education by introducing EHC Plans and ensuring high-quality provision. By following these steps, parents can ensure their child receives the necessary support to succeed in school.","['', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 2: Definition of Additional Learning Needs (ALN)\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 6: Participation and Rights\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 9: Access to Information and Advice\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 10: Individual Development Plans (IDPs)\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 11: Duties to Decide: Maintained Schools and Further Education Institutions\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 14: Duties of Local Authorities and Schools\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 68: Dispute Resolution Mechanisms\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 70: Appeals to the Education Tribunal for Wales']",1,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Scotland,"An employee in Scotland has recently lost a child and is unsure of their entitlement to bereavement leave. Under the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018, what are their rights, and what obligations does the employer have?","Under the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018, incorporated into the Employment Rights Act 1996 and the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, employees in Scotland who have lost a child are entitled to specific rights, and employers have corresponding obligations. Section 80EA of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (as amended) grants eligible employees the right to take at least two weeks of parental bereavement leave. This leave must be taken within 56 days from the date of the child’s death and applies to the death of a child under 18. Section 80EE extends these rights to cases involving stillbirths after 24 weeks of pregnancy. Employers are obligated to provide this leave, ensuring that eligible employees can take time off without facing any detriment or dismissal related to their leave request. For statutory parental bereavement pay, Section 171ZZ6 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (as amended) outlines the entitlement, specifying that the employee must meet certain conditions such as a continuous employment period of at least 26 weeks ending with the ""relevant week"" (the week immediately before the child’s death) and minimum earnings meeting the lower earnings limit. Section 171ZZ7 adds that employees must give notice to their employer about the weeks for which they seek parental bereavement pay, and employers may require this notice in writing. Regulations under this section may also stipulate further requirements, such as providing evidence of entitlement or conditions for determining continuous employment. In addition to these primary sections, reviewing supporting regulations linked to the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018 and related guidance is essential for comprehensive compliance. Regulations detail how leave is to be taken, how statutory pay is processed, and additional procedural requirements for both employees and employers.","In Scotland, an employee who has recently experienced the death of a child may be eligible for parental bereavement leave under the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations 2020. To determine entitlement, the employee must satisfy one of the conditions specified in paragraph (2) of regulation 4.

The conditions include:

(a) The employee is C's parent;
(b) The employee is C's natural parent and named in an order made pursuant to section 51A(2)(a) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 or section 11(3)(aa) of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, provided that such an order has not subsequently been revoked or discharged;
(c) The employee is a person with whom C has been placed for adoption, for so long as that placement has not been disrupted;
(d) The employee is an adopter who has received official notification in respect of C;
(e) The employee is an intended parent of C;
(f) The employee is C's parent in fact; or
(g) The employee is the partner of P.

It is essential to note that the employee must also comply with the notice requirements in regulation 6. 

Once the employee satisfies one of these conditions, they are entitled to take parental bereavement leave under this regulation. The regulations provide for a certain period of leave, which can be taken without penalty or deduction from pay.

The employer has an obligation to provide the necessary support and resources during this time. However, the specifics of the obligations vary depending on the individual circumstances.

In general, the employer is required to ensure that the employee's job is protected during the bereavement leave period. This may involve offering alternative arrangements or ensuring that the employee's pay remains intact.

However, it's worth noting that the regulations do not explicitly state what obligations the employer has in terms of providing additional support or resources during this time.

It is recommended that employees review their employment contract and speak with HR or a supervisor to understand their specific entitlements and any additional support they may be eligible for.","['', ' 1.

Scotland,"A tenant in Scotland has reported significant dampness and mold in their rented flat to the landlord, who has not taken any action. Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, what are the landlord's obligations, and what steps can the tenant take to enforce these obligations?","Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, landlords are required to ensure that their rental properties meet the Repairing Standard, as defined in Section 13 of the Act. This includes ensuring that the property is wind and watertight, reasonably fit for human habitation, and that the structure and exterior are in a reasonable state of repair. Additionally, installations for the supply of water, gas, electricity, sanitation, heating, and hot water must be kept in proper working order. Significant dampness and mold indicate a failure to meet this standard. Under Section 14, landlords have a duty to ensure that the house meets the repairing standard at the start of the tenancy and throughout its duration. This duty requires landlords to complete any necessary repairs within a reasonable time after being notified by the tenant or otherwise becoming aware of the need for repairs. Failure to act within a reasonable timeframe constitutes a breach of this duty. If the landlord does not take action, the tenant can apply to the First-tier Tribunal under Section 22 of the Act. This section allows tenants to seek a decision from the Tribunal if the property does not meet the Repairing Standard. The Tribunal can investigate and issue a Repairing Standard Enforcement Order (RSEO) under Section 24, compelling the landlord to carry out the required repairs within a specified timeframe. If the landlord fails to comply with the RSEO, under Section 26, the Tribunal must notify the local authority and may consider imposing a rent relief order to reduce the tenant’s rent. The Tribunal may excuse non-compliance if the landlord demonstrates an inability to comply due to a lack of necessary rights (e.g., access) or if the required work poses a danger to any person. In such cases, the Tribunal must notify the local authority of its findings. The Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 provides tenants with clear mechanisms to address substandard housing conditions and enforce their rights against landlords who fail to fulfill their obligations. These regulations govern the procedures of the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland Housing and Property Chamber, which is responsible for handling cases brought under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, including applications related to the Repairing Standard. The regulations ensure that disputes between tenants and landlords are resolved fairly and efficiently. They outline the rules for submitting applications, conducting hearings, issuing decisions, and enforcing orders such as Repairing Standard Enforcement Orders (RSEOs). This procedural framework directly supports tenants in seeking remedies for landlords' failures to meet their legal obligations under the Act.","I'd be happy to help you with this scenario under Scottish law.

Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, landlords in Scotland have a number of obligations towards their tenants, including maintaining the condition of the property. Specifically, section 1(2) of the Act states that a landlord must not cause the housing to become unfit for occupation by failing to carry out necessary repairs.

In this scenario, the tenant has reported significant dampness and mold in their rented flat, which suggests that the property is indeed becoming unfit for occupation due to the landlord's failure to take action. Therefore, under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, the landlord's obligations include:

1. Carrying out necessary repairs to the property to prevent the housing from becoming unfit for occupation.
2. Ensuring that the property is kept in a reasonable state of repair and maintenance.

As the tenant has already reported the issue to the landlord and they have failed to take action, the tenant may be able to take steps to enforce these obligations under the Act.

One possible course of action for the tenant would be to serve a notice on the landlord requiring them to carry out necessary repairs within a specified timeframe (usually 14 days). If the landlord fails to comply with this notice, the tenant may be able to take further action to protect their rights.

Under section 18 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, if the tenant is in arrears or suffering financial hardship due to the landlord's failure to carry out necessary repairs, they may also be entitled to seek a rent reduction. This could help mitigate any impact on the tenant's finances.

It's worth noting that the Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) (Scotland) Act 2022 has introduced additional protections for tenants in Scotland, including the right to request rent reductions and exemptions from eviction in certain circumstances. However, these provisions do not affect the landlord's obligations under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006.

Overall, I would advise the tenant to seek advice from a local housing association or tenant organization for guidance on how to proceed with enforcing their rights under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 and any relevant additional protections under the Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) (Scotland) Act 2022.","['', ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 13: The Repairing Standard\r\n', "" Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 14: Landlord's Duty to Repair and Maintain\r\n"", ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 22: Application to the First', 'tier Tribunal\r\n', ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 24: Repairing Standard Enforcement Order (RSEO)\r\n', ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 26: Effect of Failure to Comply with Repairing Standard Enforcement Order\r\n', ' Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014\r\n', ' First', 'tier Tribunal for Scotland Housing and Property Chamber (Procedure) Regulations 2017 https://www.legislation.gov.Unitedkingdom/ssi/2017/328/contents/made']",1,False,"Safeguards for landlords: substantial rent arrears and financial hardship

Scotland,"An individual in Scotland is experiencing domestic abuse from their partner with whom they share a tenancy. They wish to remove the abuser from the home but are unsure of their rights. Under the Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021, what legal protections are available, and what steps should they take?","Individuals experiencing domestic abuse in Scotland can seek protection through several legal mechanisms. Under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, they can apply for a Non-Harassment Order, which prohibits the abuser from engaging in threatening or harassing behavior. Additionally, the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981 allows for an Exclusion Order to remove the abuser from the shared home and prevent them from re-entering. This Act applies not only to married couples but also to cohabitants. The individual should contact the police to report the abuse, as domestic abuse is a criminal offense under the Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2018, which recognizes controlling behavior as abuse. Seeking legal advice from a solicitor experienced in domestic abuse cases is advisable to assist with applications for protective orders, and engaging with support services such as Scottish Women's Aid can provide additional assistance and guidance.","I'd be happy to help you understand your legal options under the Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021.

Under this Act, if an individual in Scotland is experiencing domestic abuse from their partner with whom they share a tenancy, they have several legal protections available. Firstly, they can issue a Domestic Abuse Protection Notice to the perpetrator, which requires them to leave the shared accommodation or not return after being served with the notice.

To obtain a Domestic Abuse Protection Notice, the individual must demonstrate that:

1. They are or have been in a domestic relationship with the perpetrator.
2. The relationship has ended or is likely to end, and
3. The individual has suffered abuse from the perpetrator.

If the court grants the Protection Notice, it will typically require the perpetrator to vacate the premises within 28 days of being served with the notice.

Another important provision under this Act is the right to terminate a Scottish secure tenancy in cases involving abusive behavior by a tenant towards their partner or ex-partner. This allows the individual to seek a termination of the tenancy on grounds of abuse, even if the landlord has not been directly involved.

To initiate a tenancy termination, the individual must:

1. Demonstrate that they have suffered abuse from the perpetrator.
2. Provide evidence of the abuse, which can include police reports, witness statements, or medical records.
3. Apply to the court for an order terminating the tenancy.

If the court grants the termination, it will typically require the landlord to terminate the tenancy and vacate the premises.

In addition to these specific provisions, the Act also provides protection for individuals who are experiencing domestic abuse, including:

1. Right to stay: An individual experiencing domestic abuse is entitled to remain in their home until a Protection Notice or court order has been served.
2. Safe accommodation: The individual can request assistance from local authorities or other agencies to find alternative safe accommodation.

To take advantage of these protections, the individual should:

1. Seek advice from a solicitor specializing in family law and domestic abuse.
2. Contact the National Domestic Abuse Helpline (0300 200 2477) for support and guidance.
3. Visit a local domestic abuse support service or refuge to access safe accommodation.

It's essential to note that these protections are subject to change, and individual circumstances may affect eligibility. Seeking advice from a qualified professional is crucial in navigating the complexities of domestic abuse law in Scotland.","['', ' Protection from Harassment Act 1997\r\n', ' Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981\r\n', ' Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2018']",1,False,"Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021

Scotland,"A retailer in Scotland is considering selling alcohol below the minimum unit price due to competitive pressures. They want to know the legal implications. Under the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012, what are the retailer's obligations, and what penalties could they face for non-compliance? ","Under the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012, which amends the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, retailers in Scotland are required to sell alcohol at or above a minimum unit price (MPU) set by the Scottish Ministers. This rule applies to all licensed premises, including shops, bars, restaurants, and temporary events with occasional licenses. The minimum price condition is detailed in Schedule 3, Paragraph 6A for premises licenses and Schedule 4, Paragraph 5A for occasional licenses. Alcohol must be sold at a minimum price calculated by multiplying the MPU by the strength and volume of the alcohol. As amended by The Alcohol (Minimum Price per Unit) (Scotland) Order 2018, the current MPU is set at 65 pence per unit. Retailers must comply with this minimum price, and selling alcohol below this threshold constitutes a breach of licensing conditions. If a retailer fails to meet the minimum pricing requirement, Section 36 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 allows the licensing board to review the premises license and impose penalties as needed. Following a review, the board may suspend the license temporarily, revoke the license entirely, or modify the license conditions to enforce compliance. These penalties aim to uphold public health and ensure responsible alcohol sales.","In Scotland, under the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012, retailers who sell alcohol below the minimum unit price without a valid exemption are in breach of their licensing conditions. 

The minimum unit price is currently set at £8 per unit of alcohol, and retailers are required to ensure that all alcohol they sell is priced at or above this amount.

For retailers selling below the minimum unit price without an exemption, there could be serious consequences including fines and penalties from the Licensing Board, which may lead to license suspension or revocation.","['', ' Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, Schedule 3, Paragraph 6A ', ' Premises Licence Mandatory Conditions\r\n', ' Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, Schedule 4, Paragraph 5A ', ' Occasional Licence Mandatory Conditions\r\n', ' The Alcohol (Minimum Price per Unit) (Scotland) Order 2018 ', ' Minimum Unit Pricing for Alcohol in Scotland\r\n', ' Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, Section 36 ', ' Application for Review of Premises Licence:']",1,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Scotland,"A parent in Scotland believes their child requires additional support in school due to a learning difficulty. Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 (as amended), what rights does the child have, and what steps can the parent take to secure the necessary support?","Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004, as amended, children in Scotland who require additional support due to learning difficulties are legally entitled to specific rights. Education authorities have a duty to assess and provide for these needs when required. According to Section 8(1), if a parent requests an assessment to determine whether their child has additional support needs or requires a Co-ordinated Support Plan (CSP), the education authority must comply with this request unless it is deemed unreasonable. Following assessment, Section 4(1)(a) requires the education authority to make adequate and efficient provision for the identified needs, which can include specialized resources or tailored teaching approaches. If a child’s support needs involve multiple agencies, such as social work or healthcare in addition to education, Section 9(1) ensures they are entitled to a CSP, a document outlining coordinated support across agencies. Parents also have the right, under Section 12(2), to be actively involved in developing and reviewing support plans to ensure that their child’s educational requirements are fully understood and addressed. If disagreements arise regarding the support provided or decisions made, Section 18(1) grants parents the right to appeal to the Additional Support Needs Tribunal for Scotland, which can make binding rulings on disputes related to additional support. These legislative provisions provide a strong framework for ensuring children’s educational needs are met and give parents a clear process to advocate for the support their child requires.","I'd be happy to help clarify the rights of a child with a learning difficulty in Scotland and guide you through the process of securing additional support.

As per the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004, children in Scotland have the right to receive additional support to meet their individual needs. This act emphasizes the importance of providing accessible and inclusive education for all pupils, including those with special educational needs.

Under this act, a child's rights include:

1. The right to a personalized Educational Psychologist's report: Parents can request an Educational Psychologist's report to identify the child's strengths, weaknesses, and learning difficulties.
2. The right to a Personal Learning Plan (PLP): A PLP is a tailored plan that outlines the child's learning objectives, strategies for achieving them, and regular progress reviews.
3. The right to additional support: Parents can request additional support from the school, such as speech therapy, occupational therapy, or special educational needs coordinators.

To secure additional support for your child, you can follow these steps:

1. Request an Educational Psychologist's report: Schedule a meeting with the school's Educational Psychologist to discuss your concerns and request a report.
2. Meet with the Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCO): Discuss your child's needs with the SENCO, who will assess their requirements and develop a PLP.
3. Attend an Annual Review Meeting: Participate in the Annual Review Meeting to review your child's progress, adjust their PLP as needed, and discuss any further support required.
4. Escalate concerns: If you're not satisfied with the support provided, you can escalate your concerns to the school's governing body or the Local Authority.

It's essential to note that as a parent, you have the right to be involved in the decision-making process regarding your child's additional support. Don't hesitate to ask questions, seek clarification, and advocate for your child's needs.

Regarding advocacy services, the Deprivation of Liberty Orders (Scotland) Regulations 2022 require local authorities to inform children about their availability. While this regulation primarily focuses on the rights of children in care or residential settings, it highlights the importance of providing support and representation to ensure a child's voice is heard.

In your case, while advocacy services might not directly apply to your situation (as you're not referring to a Deprivation of Liberty Order), they do underscore the significance of ensuring that all students receive support and representation in achieving their educational goals.",['Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004'],1,False,"Provision of advocacy services

NothernIreland,"An individual in NothernIreland is experiencing domestic abuse and seeks protection from their abuser. Under the Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (NothernIreland) 2021, what legal protections are available, and what steps should they take to secure those protections?","An individual in NothernIreland experiencing domestic abuse is protected under the Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (NothernIreland) 2021. Specifically, Section 1 of the Act criminalizes a course of abusive behaviour towards a person to whom the abuser is personally connected, such as a partner, ex-partner, or family member. The individual should report the abuse to the Police Service of NothernIreland to initiate a criminal investigation under this Act. Section 2 defines ""abusive behaviour"" as behaviour that is violent or threatening, or behaviour where a reasonable person would consider the course of behaviour likely to cause one or more of the following effects on the victim (B):
                                       * Making B dependent on, or subordinate to, A (the abuser);
                                       * Isolating B from friends, relatives, or other sources of social interaction or support;
                                       * Controlling, regulating, or monitoring B's day-to-day activities;
                                       * Depriving B of, or restricting, freedom of action;
                                       * Frightening, humiliating, degrading, or punishing B.
While the Act does not provide specific protective orders, the individual may apply for a Non-Molestation Order or an Occupation Order under the Family Homes and Domestic Violence (NothernIreland) Order 1998. A Non-Molestation Order can prohibit the abuser from molesting the applicant or a relevant child, and an Occupation Order can regulate the occupation of the shared residence. Additionally, Sections 25 to 28 of the Act offer special measures in civil proceedings to support victims, such as prohibiting the abuser from cross-examining the victim in person.
To secure these protections, the individual should:
                                       1. Report the abuse to the Police Service of NothernIreland to initiate criminal proceedings under the Act.
                                       2. Seek legal advice to apply for a Non-Molestation Order or an Occupation Order through the courts.

Under the Domestic Abuse Act (Northern Ireland) 2021, an individual can seek protection from their abuser through a Domestic Abuse Protection Order. This order is a court-issued injunction that provides safety and security for the person seeking protection.

To secure a Domestic Abuse Protection Order, the individual must demonstrate to the court that they are at risk of serious violence or harm from their abuser. The court will consider various factors, including:

1. Past incidents of domestic abuse
2. Current circumstances of the relationship
3. The abuser's likelihood of committing further harm

If the court is satisfied that an order is necessary, it can be issued for a specific period, typically up to three months, with the option to extend or modify it.

In addition to a Domestic Abuse Protection Order, individuals may also be able to seek other legal protections under various statutes and regulations. For example:

1. Restraining Orders: These are court-issued orders that prohibit an individual from contacting or approaching another person. They can provide temporary relief while the Domestic Abuse Protection Order is sought.
2. Civil Proceedings: The Domestic Abuse Act provides a framework for addressing domestic abuse in civil proceedings, such as disputes over property or financial arrangements.

To secure these protections, the individual should:

1. Seek advice from a solicitor who specializes in family law and domestic abuse cases. They can provide guidance on the best course of action and represent them in court.
2. Contact local support services, such as the Northern Ireland Domestic Abuse Helpline (0808 01 00 800) or the National Domestic Violence Helpline (0300 123 4135), for emotional support and information about available resources.
3. Complete a Domestic Abuse Protection Order application form, which can be obtained from the court or downloaded from the Ministry of Justice website.

It's essential to note that the individual must demonstrate that they are at risk of harm to secure these protections. The court will consider their specific circumstances and take into account any relevant factors.

In summary, individuals experiencing domestic abuse in Northern Ireland have access to various legal protections under the Domestic Abuse Act 2021, including Domestic Abuse Protection Orders, restraining orders, and civil proceedings. Seeking advice from a solicitor and contacting local support services are crucial steps in securing these protections.","['', ' Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (NothernIreland) 2021\r\n', ' Family Homes and Domestic Violence (NothernIreland) Order 1998']",1,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

NothernIreland,"An employee in NothernIreland suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage. Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015, what are their rights, and what steps can they take to address the issue?","Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015, an employee in NothernIreland who suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage (NMW) has specific rights and actionable steps to address the issue. The Act mandates that employees must be paid at least the NMW, as set out in Section 1(1), which establishes the legal entitlement to minimum wage for all qualifying workers. Employers are legally required to keep accurate records of wage payments under Section 9 of the Act. These records should be sufficient to demonstrate that an employee is being paid at least the NMW. Therefore, the first step for the employee is to review their pay records to confirm any potential underpayment. Should there be a discrepancy, Section 10 grants the employee the right to formally request access to these records, enabling them to verify their calculations against the NMW requirement. If the employee identifies an underpayment, they should raise this issue with their employer, as it may be an oversight. If the employer fails to resolve the issue, the employee can escalate the matter to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the body responsible for enforcing compliance. While Section 13 of the Act authorizes the Secretary of State to appoint officers for enforcement purposes, Section 14 provides HMRC officers with the power to issue enforcement notices if employers are found non-compliant.  While the Act provides the primary framework, the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015 offer additional details for specific situations, such as valuing accommodation benefits or adjusting for absences, which can influence wage calculations. For most straightforward underpayment cases, the Act alone provides the necessary rights and procedures, with the Regulations supporting only in specific circumstances affecting wage calculation. In addition to these provisions, the Employment Rights (NothernIreland) Order 1996 is also relevant as it grants the employee a procedural framework for seeking redress if they are not compensated as per the NMW. Under the 1996 Order, if an employee experiences a sustained issue with underpayment, they have the right to file a claim with an Industrial Tribunal. This Order, though not specifically addressing minimum wage rates, is essential for the employee’s right to fair wages, as it permits claims for unlawful deduction of wages or breach of contract, allowing the employee to recover underpaid amounts. The 1996 Order thus complements the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 by establishing legal recourse in cases of wage disputes.","If an employee in Northern Ireland suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage, they have several rights under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2015. 

Firstly, the employee is entitled to be paid at least the applicable minimum wage rate for their employment type and any relevant modifications, as specified in the National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015.

According to Section 2 of the Regulations, The National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015 are amended in accordance with this Part. However, this does not imply that the employee can be paid below the National Minimum Wage. The amendments may have introduced or modified certain provisions, but they do not affect the fundamental principle of paying at least the minimum wage.

To address the issue, the employee should:

1. Review their employment contract: Check the contract to confirm the agreed-upon pay rate and ensure that it is consistent with the applicable National Minimum Wage Regulations.
2. Keep accurate records: Maintain a record of all payments made by the employer, including dates, amounts, and any deductions.
3. Notify the employer: Inform the employer in writing about the suspected underpayment, providing details of the relevant minimum wage rate and evidence to support their claim.
4. File a complaint with Acas or an employment tribunal (ET): If the employee believes that they have been underpaid, they can submit a complaint to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) or file a claim with an employment tribunal (ET). The ET will investigate the matter and make a decision on whether the employer has breached the National Minimum Wage Regulations.
5. Claim back pay: If the ET finds in favour of the employee, they may be entitled to claim back pay for the period during which they were underpaid.

It is essential to note that employees should not attempt to take matters into their own hands or engage in unprotected industrial action, such as strikes or picketing, unless instructed by an employer representative. Failure to do so could result in further consequences, including fines and potential employment contracts termination.","['', ' National Minimum Wage Act 1998\r\n', ' National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015\r\n', ' The Employment Rights (NothernIreland) Order 1996']",1,False,"2.

NothernIreland,"An employee in NothernIreland has recently lost a child and is unsure about their entitlement to bereavement leave and pay. Under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022, what are their rights, and how can they access them?","Under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022, an employee in NothernIreland who has recently lost a child is entitled to bereavement leave, and if they meet certain criteria, they may also be eligible for bereavement pay. Article 112EA(1)-(3) defines a ""bereaved parent"" as an employee who meets specified relationship conditions with the deceased child, which may include a caregiving role before the child’s death. Employees who lose a child under 18, or experience a stillbirth after 24 weeks of pregnancy, are entitled to at least two weeks of bereavement leave under Article 112EA(5). This leave can be taken either as a single two-week block or in two separate one-week periods. According to Article 112EA(6), this leave must be taken within at least 56 days (eight weeks) from the date of the child’s death, providing flexibility within that period.
If an employee loses more than one child, Article 112EA(7) entitles them to bereavement leave for each child. Article 112EB outlines rights during and after bereavement leave, specifying that employees on leave retain most employment terms and conditions (excluding remuneration). According to Article 112EB(1)(a)-(c), employees are entitled to return to their original or an equivalent job after bereavement leave. Furthermore, Article 112EB(3) provides that if bereavement leave coincides with other types of parental leave (such as maternity or paternity leave), the right to return applies across the entire period of absence.
To access bereavement leave, Article 112ED(a) requires employees to notify their employer as soon as reasonably practicable, specifying the intended dates for leave. Employers are obligated to grant this leave and cannot delay or refuse it. If the employee is also eligible for statutory bereavement pay, they must provide notice and any required documentation as directed under Articles 112ED(a) and (c).","I'd be happy to help you understand your employee's rights under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay regulations in Northern Ireland.

Firstly, it's essential to note that the relevant legislation governing bereavement leave and pay in Northern Ireland is not the ""Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act"" (which does not exist), but rather the amendments made by The Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay (Consequential Amendments to Subordinate Legislation) Regulations 2020.

Under these regulations, employees in Northern Ireland are entitled to bereavement leave and pay following the death of a child. Here's what they can expect:

1. **Bereavement leave**: Employees are entitled to take up to three days' paid leave after the death of their child. This leave is intended to allow them to attend to personal matters, make funeral arrangements, or simply cope with their grief.
2. **Eligibility**: To be eligible for bereavement leave and pay, employees must have been employed for at least 13 weeks prior to the date of the child's death.
3. **Pay**: Employees are entitled to receive up to 90% of their average weekly earnings (AWE) for up to three consecutive days following the child's death. This means that if an employee earns £500 per week, they would be entitled to receive £450 (£500 x 0.9).
4. **Notice period**: Employees do not need to give notice before taking bereavement leave. However, it is recommended that they provide reasonable notice to their employer where possible.
5. **Qualifying child**: The regulations define a qualifying child as the child of whom the employee was a parent, step-parent, or adoptive parent.

To access these rights, employees should:

1. Inform their employer about their bereavement leave and pay entitlements.
2. Provide evidence of the child's death (e.g., death certificate).
3. Follow their employer's procedures for taking bereavement leave and receiving pay.

It's essential to note that employers in Northern Ireland are not required to provide a specific number of paid days, but rather up to three consecutive days' pay. The amount of pay received will depend on the employee's earnings and employment contract.

If your employee is unsure about their entitlements or needs further guidance, I recommend they speak with their HR representative, manager, or seek advice from an Acas (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service) representative.

I hope this information helps alleviate some of the uncertainty surrounding your employee's rights in Northern Ireland.","['', ' Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022']",1,False,"EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to secondary legislation in consequence of Regulations made under the Employment Rights Act 1996 and Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, which make provision for entitlements to bereavement leave and pay for parents following the death of a child.
These Regulations are part of a package of legislative measures and the relevant impact assessment is the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill impact assessment which was published on 14 May 2018. A copy of that impact assessment can be obtained from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Labour Market Directorate, 1 Victoria Street, London, SW1H 0ET.","{'category': 'May contain legislation that applies to NothernIreland', 'country': 'NothernIreland', 'file': 'The Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay (Consequential Amendments to Subordinate Legislation) Regulations 2020.txt', 'legislation': 'UK Statutory Instruments', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/354/note', 'year': '2020'}"
NothernIreland,"A tenant in NothernIreland has been served an eviction notice by their landlord, giving them four weeks to vacate the property. The tenant has lived there for two years under a periodic tenancy. Under the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, is the notice period valid, and what rights does the tenant have?","Under the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, a landlord’s notice to quit a property must meet specific statutory notice periods based on the length of the tenancy. This Act amends the Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006, particularly Article 14, to reflect updated notice requirements. For a tenant who has lived in the property for two years under a periodic tenancy, Section 11 of the 2022 Act amends Article 14 of the 2006 Order to specify that the landlord must provide at least 4 months’ notice before requiring the tenant to vacate. This 4-month period applies to tenancies that have existed for more than 12 months but not more than 3 years (as outlined in the new Article 14(1A)(b)). Because the landlord provided only four weeks’ notice, this does not satisfy the legal requirement, rendering the notice invalid. The tenant has the right to remain in the property until a valid notice to quit is served that meets the legally required notice period. Under Section 11 of the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, which amends Article 14 of the Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006, landlords are required to give a minimum 4-month notice for tenancies that have lasted more than 12 months but not more than 3 years. Because the tenant has lived in the property for two years, the landlord’s four-week notice does not meet this requirement and is therefore invalid. The tenant may choose to inform the landlord in writing that the notice is invalid due to the insufficient notice period, referencing Article 14(1), which states that a notice to quit is only valid if it complies with the minimum notice periods required by law. If the landlord proceeds with eviction attempts despite the invalid notice, the tenant may seek legal remedies. While specific injunctions or protections against harassment are not outlined within this tenancy legislation, the tenant may still seek legal assistance through broader NothernIreland housing or civil law protections to prevent an unlawful eviction and maintain peaceful possession of the property.","Under the Private Tenancies (Coronavirus Modifications) Act (Northern Ireland) 2020, the notice period for a tenant in Northern Ireland has been temporarily modified due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Initially, the relevant notice period under the Private Tenancies (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 was 8 weeks. However, during the emergency period, Article 14 of the Order was amended to replace ""the relevant period"" with ""12 weeks"". This means that a landlord in Northern Ireland can now serve a tenant with an eviction notice giving them only 12 weeks to vacate the property.

However, in this case, since you mentioned that the tenant has lived there for two years under a periodic tenancy and was served an eviction notice by their landlord giving them four weeks to vacate the property, we need to examine if this is an extended notice period or not. 

Given the fact that the original order stated ""8 weeks"" notice period and Article 14 of the Private Tenancies (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 has been amended to say 12 weeks during the emergency period, if the tenant lives in a periodic tenancy, it might be reasonable for this to also have an extension.

If not, then the landlord is trying to exploit the situation by using the ""emergency period"" rule that does not apply under the original order, but rather is only intended to cover landlords serving new tenants, and thus might not be valid in a periodic tenancy. However if this is the case, I would need more information.

Under the Private Tenancies (Coronavirus Modifications) Act (Northern Ireland) 2020, as far as we can tell that it seems the tenant has three weeks left under the original eight-week notice period for their periodic tenancy, not twelve weeks.","['', ' Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022 ', ' Section 11\r\n', ' Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006 ', ' Article 14']",1,False,"Notice to quit: private tenancies

NothernIreland,"An individual in NothernIreland is being harassed and stalked by an ex-partner, causing them significant distress. Under the Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022, what legal protections are available to them, and what steps should they take to ensure their safety?","Under the Protection from Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022, individuals in NothernIreland who are being harassed and stalked by an ex-partner can rely on specific legal protections. The Act clearly defines stalking as a criminal offense in Section 1, where engaging in a course of conduct causing another person to experience fear, alarm, or substantial distress constitutes stalking. Such conduct includes following, contacting, monitoring usage of electronic communications, and other invasive behaviors. Offenders can face severe penalties, with up to 10 years imprisonment or a fine upon conviction on indictment, or up to 12 months imprisonment or a statutory maximum fine upon summary conviction. Additionally, the Act allows for Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs), detailed in Section 7, which the Chief Constable can apply for. These orders are designed to prevent further stalking activities by imposing specific prohibitions or requirements on the stalker. The eligibility for an SPO is based on evidence that the individual has engaged in stalking, poses a risk related to stalking, and that the order is necessary to protect someone from this risk. These orders can be applied against anyone residing in, or intending to visit, NothernIreland. The duration of these orders is addressed in Section 9, where an SPO can last for a minimum of two years or until further court order. The court may specify that some conditions within the SPO remain effective until further judicial review while setting others for fixed periods. This flexibility allows the protective measures to be adapted over time to match the needs of the situation. For their safety, affected individuals should report stalking incidents to the Police Service of NothernIreland (PSNI), enabling legal proceedings that could include the issuance of an SPO. Consulting legal advice and engaging with support services are also advisable steps to ensure comprehensive protection and support.","Under the Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, an individual who is being harassed and stalked by an ex-partner can seek various legal protections. First and foremost, they have the right to be protected from stalking and threatening or abusive behavior.

One of the key provisions of the Act is Section 4, which defines stalking as ""any act intended to harass, alarm or distress"" a person. This definition includes physical or verbal actions that are meant to cause fear, anxiety, or harm.

In terms of legal protections, an individual who is being stalked can make a complaint to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). The PSNI has a dedicated Stalking Unit that can investigate and take action against perpetrators. If the police confirm that stalking is taking place, they can issue warnings, impose restrictions on the perpetrator's behavior, and even arrest them if necessary.

The Act also provides for the creation of a civil protection order (CPO), which can be sought by an individual who feels threatened or harassed. A CPO prohibits the perpetrator from approaching, contacting, or engaging in certain behaviors that would cause harm to the victim. These orders can be enforced by the police and other authorities.

Another important provision is Section 7, which deals with the power of courts to make orders to protect victims. The court can issue orders, such as prohibitive injunctions, to prevent perpetrators from committing stalking or harassing behavior.

In addition to these measures, the Act also provides for support services and resources for victims. For example, section 10 requires the Northern Ireland Office to establish a dedicated service to provide help and guidance to those affected by stalking.

To ensure their safety, an individual who is being stalked should take the following steps:

1. **Contact the police immediately**: Reach out to the PSNI and report any incidents of harassment or stalking. The police will investigate and take action against the perpetrator.
2. **Seek a civil protection order**: If you feel threatened or harassed, apply for a CPO through the courts. This can provide a temporary measure to protect you from further harm.
3. **Contact support services**: Reach out to organizations such as Victim Support Northern Ireland (VSNI) or Women's Aid Northern Ireland for guidance and assistance.
4. **Keep records of incidents**: Document any incidents, including dates, times, locations, and details of what happened. This can be helpful when reporting to the police or applying for a CPO.
5. **Seek support from friends and family**: Talk to trusted friends and family members about your situation and ask for their support.

Overall, while the Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 provides various legal protections and resources for victims, it is essential for individuals to take proactive steps to ensure their safety and well-being.","['', ' Protection from Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022']",1,False,"Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022
