Unitedkingdom,"An employee in England is currently on maternity leave under the Employment Rights Act 1996. During her leave, her employer announces a redundancy process due to company restructuring. Additionally, there are health and safety concerns at the workplace that might affect her return. Considering the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (as amended), the Equality Act 2010, the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, and relevant case law, what protections does she have during redundancy, and how should the employer proceed?","Under the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999, specifically Regulation 10, if an employee on maternity leave is at risk of redundancy, she must be offered any suitable alternative vacancy available before it is offered to other employees, giving her priority for redeployment opportunities. The Equality Act 2010, particularly Section 18, prohibits discrimination because of pregnancy or maternity, requiring employers to ensure that redundancy selection criteria do not disadvantage employees on maternity leave to avoid unlawful discrimination claims. Regarding health and safety, the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, Regulation 16, mandates employers to perform a specific risk assessment for new or expectant mothers, and if risks are identified and cannot be avoided, the employer must adjust her working conditions or hours, offer suitable alternative work on no less favorable terms, or if no alternative is available, suspend her on full pay. Relevant case law, such as Sefton Borough Council v Wainwright [2014] EWCA Civ 953, confirms the obligation to offer suitable alternative employment to employees on maternity leave before others. Therefore, the employer must conduct a fair and non-discriminatory redundancy process, prioritize the employee for any suitable alternative positions, and address health and safety concerns by performing risk assessments and taking necessary actions to protect the employee.","Given the current circumstances, the employee is entitled to protection under the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (as amended) and the Equality Act 2010.

Protection from Detriment:

1.  The Employee's Right to Reinstatement or Redeployment:

    Under the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999, an employee on maternity leave has a right to reinstatement upon return, provided that she was in her normal working hours at the time of taking her leave and continued to perform her duties before leaving for maternity purposes (Regulation 8(1)). This protection applies regardless of whether she is dismissed during her pregnancy or after returning from maternity leave.

    Additionally, under the Equality Act 2010, an employee who is pregnant, on maternity leave, or has a new child should not be treated less favorably than someone who is not in a similar situation. The employer must consider reinstatement as part of their procedures for dealing with employees on maternity leave (Section 79(1) of the Equality Act 2010).

2.  Protection from Dismissal and Redundancy:

    Under the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999, an employee cannot be dismissed or made redundant solely because she is pregnant or has a child.

    Similarly, under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, an employer must not dismiss or terminate employment solely on grounds related to health and safety (Regulation 1(5)). The Act requires that employers consider the impact of dismissal on employees' ability to work safely and effectively.

3.  Redundancy Procedure:

    When announcing a redundancy process due to company restructuring, the employer should provide clear information about the selection criteria for redundancy and the procedure for handling such situations. However, this does not necessarily protect an employee who is pregnant or on maternity leave from dismissal based solely on her pregnancy or childcare responsibilities.

    In light of the above considerations, the employer must consider the following steps: 1) Provide notice of the redundancy process in accordance with the Redundancy (Consideration of Qualifying Employees) Regulations 1995. 2) Follow proper procedures to handle employee requests for redeployment or protection from redundancy. However, if an employee is on maternity leave and then becomes redundant due to health concerns at work, the employer should consider the possibility of being made redundant solely due to her pregnancy.

    In such cases, the Employee has a right to reinstatement upon return or redeployment. The employer must also take into account the impact of redundancy on employees' ability to return to work safely and effectively after parental leave. This might involve providing suitable training or adjustments to ensure an employee can continue working in the same role if needed.

    If the employee is dismissed or becomes redundant solely due to her pregnancy, she may be entitled to compensation under Section 124(1) of the Equality Act 2010. The employer must demonstrate that they did not treat her less favorably than someone who was not pregnant and had a child, in order to avoid liability.

4.  Redundancy after Return from Maternity Leave:

    When deciding on redundancy for an employee returning from maternity leave, the employer should take into account the fact that she has been absent due to pregnancy-related illness or family responsibilities, as well as any health concerns at work.

    The employer should assess whether there are suitable alternative roles available within the organization that could accommodate her needs. This may involve training and adjustments to ensure she can continue working in the same role if needed. In order for an employee returning from maternity leave not to be dismissed solely because of health and safety concerns, she must have been employed for at least 26 weeks prior to her leave.

    If the employer decides to dismiss her after considering whether there are suitable alternative roles available, they should provide clear explanations for their decision.","['', ' Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999, Regulation 10\r\n', ' Equality Act 2010, Section 18\r\n', ' Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, Regulation 16']",5,True,"Protection from detriment

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers inserted into the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 (N.I. 16) (the “1996 Order”) by the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 (c. 5).
The Regulations revoke and re-enact the provisions of the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023 which would otherwise cease to have effect by virtue of Article 251(1A) of the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996.
These Regulations provide for a statutory entitlement for bereaved parents who are employees to take up to two weeks’ leave from their job called parental bereavement leave in the 56 weeks following the death of a child.
Part 2 relates to entitlement to parental bereavement leave. The right to take parental bereavement leave is conferred by regulation 4 which sets out the conditions for entitlement which must be satisfied by the employee in order to take parental bereavement leave. These include substantive requirements, such as the employee falling within the definition of a bereaved parent (in particular, specifying the types of parental relationships in respect of which the new entitlement arises), as well as procedural requirements, such as the employee giving appropriate notices to their employer. Where an employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave under regulation 4 as the result of the death of more than one child, the employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave in respect of each child.
Regulation 5 sets out the number of weeks of parental bereavement leave that are available to a bereaved parent and gives an employee the option of taking either one or two weeks’ parental bereavement leave. The weeks taken as parental bereavement leave do not need to be taken consecutively. It also provides that parental bereavement leave may only be taken within the period of 56 weeks beginning with the date of the child’s death.
Regulation 6 details the notice requirements and other information the bereaved parent must provide to their employer before taking parental bereavement leave. An employee does not need to provide notice in writing to his or her employer, but the length of notice required to book and cancel parental bereavement leave will vary depending on whether the period the employee intends to take as parental bereavement leave falls within 56 days of the child’s death or later. Regulations 7 and 8 respectively set out when an employee’s period of bereavement leave may start and what happens when a period of parental bereavement leave is interrupted by another type of statutory leave under Part 9 of the 1996 Order.
Part 3 contains provisions applicable in relation to the taking of parental bereavement leave. Regulation 9 elaborates on the new Article 112EB of the 1996 Order, by providing that an employee is entitled during his or her absence on leave to the benefit of all of his or her terms and conditions of employment apart from the right to remuneration (excluded by Article 112EB(2)(b)); also that the employee is subject to all of the obligations under those terms and conditions except in so far as they are inconsistent with the right to take parental bereavement leave (the exception appears in Article 112EB(1)(b)). Regulations 10 and 11 provide for an employee’s right to return to work after taking a period of parental bereavement leave, distinguishing the case where the leave was an isolated period of absence from the case where it followed another period of statutory leave. Regulations 12 and 13 provide that an employee entitled to parental bereavement leave is protected from detriment and dismissal attributable to the fact that they took or sought to take parental bereavement leave.
Part 4 contains provisions applicable where an employee has a contractual right to parental bereavement leave, in addition to the statutory right contained within these Regulations.
Part 5 (regulations 16 to 22) contains provisions in respect of the Transitional arrangements that will ensure a continuity of entitlement between the revoked Regulations and current Regulations. This part also contains the revocation of the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023.
A separate impact assessment has not been prepared for these Regulations. The Regulations are part of a package of legislative measures and the relevant impact assessment is the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill impact assessment which was published in April 2020.

Unitedkingdom,"A tenant in England reports a malfunctioning carbon monoxide alarm installed under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (Amendment) Regulations 2022. Despite notifying the landlord, the alarm has not been repaired or replaced after three weeks. The tenant is concerned about safety and compliance. Under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm Regulations 2015 (as amended), what are the landlord's legal obligations, and what actions can the tenant take?","Under Regulation 6 of the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (England) Regulations 2015, when a landlord is served with a remedial notice for breaching one or more duties outlined in Regulation 4(1) (such as failing to install or maintain smoke or carbon monoxide alarms), the landlord must take the specified remedial actions within the timeframe set out in Regulation 5(2)(d), typically 28 days from the notice's issuance. This regulation imposes a clear duty on the landlord to address the breach promptly and ensures tenant safety through enforcement mechanisms. However, Regulation 6(2) provides that a landlord will not be considered in breach of this obligation if they can demonstrate that they have taken all reasonable steps, short of initiating legal proceedings, to comply with the duty. Reasonable steps may include hiring contractors, arranging access to the property, or documenting efforts to resolve tenant-related barriers to compliance. Proper evidence of these steps is crucial to establish the landlord’s diligence. This provision ensures that while landlords are held accountable, genuine efforts to comply are recognized, even if the issue remains unresolved due to circumstances beyond their control.","Under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm Regulations 2022 (and its predecessors including the regulations mentioned in document number 3) in England, a landlord has several legal obligations with regards to carbon monoxide alarms. 

As per regulation 4 of the current amendment (as mentioned in document number 2), there are specific requirements for carbon monoxide alarms in private rentals.

According to section 5 of the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (Amendment) Regulations 2022, if a tenant reports a malfunctioning prescribed alarm not working properly after October 1st, 2022, the landlord must repair or replace it within a reasonable timeframe as soon as reasonably practicable. The landlord also needs to determine whether the alarm is in proper working order and carry out any required repairs or replacements.

The regulations imply that the landlord's failure to address the issue promptly could lead to non-compliance with statutory requirements and potentially create a health hazard for the tenant.

As for the actions the tenant can take, they should first notify their landlord regarding the malfunctioning alarm in writing.

Unitedkingdom,"Residents in an English town are concerned that their local authority has not implemented separate food waste collections, as required by the Environment Act 2021. The deadline has passed, and there is no plan in place. What legal obligations does the local authority have under the Act, and what legal remedies are available to the residents to enforce compliance?","Under the Environment Act 2021, specifically Section 57, which inserts Section 45AZB into the Environmental Protection Act 1990, local authorities in England are legally obligated to arrange for the separate collection of food waste from households; failure to do so constitutes a breach of statutory duty. Residents can raise the issue with the local authority by submitting formal complaints requesting compliance, engage with local councillors and Members of Parliament (MPs) to advocate for action, and may have standing to apply for a judicial review of the local authority's failure to comply with statutory duties, as established in cases like R (on the application of Greenpeace Ltd) v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1998] Env LR 415; they must act promptly and within three months of the grounds arising.","The Environment Act 2021 (c. 30) imposes several obligations on local authorities in England regarding waste management, including separate food waste collections. Specifically, Section 68 of the Act amends Part 4 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (c. 43) to require local authorities to enforce littering and other related offenses, including non-compliance with food waste collection requirements.

Section 68(1) states that a local authority must take all reasonable steps to prevent litter and to clean up litter that has been deposited in a street or any other place. This includes implementing a food waste collection scheme as required by the Act.

Regulation 2 of the Environmental Targets (Residual Waste) Regulations 2022 brings into force provisions of the Environment Act 2021, including Section 68. According to Regulation 2(3), local authorities must bring into force the requirements specified in Section 68 within 6 months of commencement.

If the local authority has failed to implement a food waste collection scheme as required by the Environment Act 2021, residents have several legal remedies available:

1. **Request for Information**: Under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (c. 36), residents can request information from the local authority about their progress on implementing the food waste collection scheme. If the local authority fails to provide a response or provides inadequate information, residents can appeal to the Information Commissioner.
2. **Environmental Protection Complaints**: Residents can file a complaint with the Environment Agency (EA) under Section 80 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (c. 43). The EA will investigate the complaint and may issue a warning or enforcement notice to the local authority if it finds that they have failed to comply with the requirements of the Act.
3. **Housing, Planning and Local Government Act 1989**: Residents can also complain to the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government (SHC LG) under Section 107 of the HPLGA. SHC LG may investigate the complaint and take enforcement action if it finds that the local authority has failed to comply with the requirements of the Act.
4. **High Court Proceedings**: As a last resort, residents can seek injunctive relief or damages in the High Court for breach of statutory duty under the Environment Act 2021.

To enforce compliance, residents should:

1. Write to their local authority and request information about their progress on implementing the food waste collection scheme.
2. Submit a complaint to the EA if they believe their local authority has failed to comply with the requirements of the Act.
3. Contact SHC LG if they are dissatisfied with the response from the EA or local authority.

It is essential for residents to document all correspondence, complaints, and interactions with the local authority, as well as any enforcement actions taken by regulatory agencies.","['', ' Environment Act 2021, Section 57 (inserting Section 45AZB into the Environmental Protection Act 1990)\r\n', ' Environmental Protection Act 1990, Section 45AZB (as inserted by the Environment Act 2021)']",5,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Wales,"An employee lives in Wales but works in England. They are planning to take Shared Parental Leave (SPL) following the birth of their child. They are unsure how the differences between Welsh and English regulations might affect their entitlement and whether their residence in Wales impacts their rights. Under the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, what are their rights, and does their place of residence affect their entitlement? ","Under the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, which are authorized by the Employment Rights Act 1996, an employee's entitlement to Shared Parental Leave (SPL) is determined by their employment status and specific eligibility criteria, irrespective of their place of residence. The regulations apply uniformly across England and Wales. To qualify for SPL, the employee must have been continuously employed by the same employer for at least 26 weeks by the end of the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth and remain employed at the start of each period of SPL taken. Additionally, their partner must have worked (employed or self-employed) for at least 26 of the 66 weeks before the expected week of childbirth and have earned an average of at least £30 per week in 13 of those weeks. These criteria are outlined in the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014, specifically in Part 2, Chapter 1, Regulation 6. Therefore, an employee residing in Wales and working in England is entitled to SPL, provided they meet these eligibility requirements, with their place of residence having no impact on their entitlement.","Let's break down the key points regarding an employee's rights to Shared Parental Leave (SPL) under the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014.

Firstly, it is essential to understand that the employee in question lives in Wales but works in England. This context is crucial when considering their entitlement to SPL.

According to the regulations, an employee's eligibility for Shared Parental Leave depends on various factors, including their employment status, parental leave taken, and continuous leave thresholds.

Regarding the Welsh residence aspect, the key provision that applies here is regulation 39(1B) of the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014. As per this regulation, the relevant day referred to in paragraph (1A)(c) is the day after a period of 18 months beginning with the day on which the child enters Great Britain.

In this scenario, since the employee lives in Wales but has entered Great Britain with their child, they would be entitled to SPL. The Welsh residence does not appear to impact their eligibility for SPL directly; however, it is essential to note that the regulations also consider the employee's ""relevant employer,"" which could be either the English or Welsh employer.

For an employee who lives in Wales but works in England, it is recommended to assess their employment contract and understand what constitutes their ""relevant employer."" This will help determine whether they are entitled to SPL based on the Welsh or English regulations.

In summary, while the employee's place of residence in Wales may not directly affect their entitlement to SPL, it is still essential to consider the applicable regulations and assess their employment situation carefully.","['', ' Employment Rights Act 1996:\r\n', ' Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014']",5,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

These Regulations amend the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999/3312), the Paternity and Adoption Leave Regulations 2002 (S.I. 2002/2788) and the Shared Parental Leave Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/3050).

The amendments extend existing requirements that apply to employers when redundancy situations arise where an employee is on maternity, adoption or shared parental leave, so that those requirements can also apply during pregnancy and for a period of time after that leave has ended. For those taking shared parental leave who have not taken maternity or adoption leave, there is a six-week threshold of continuous leave that needs to be met for the requirements to apply for a period of time after shared parental leave has ended. Where the six-week threshold is not met, the requirements apply during shared parental leave.

Wales,"A tenant in Wales is experiencing severe damp and mold in their rented property, which the landlord has failed to address despite repeated requests. Under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, what are the landlord's obligations regarding repairs and safety, and what actions can the tenant take to enforce these obligations?","Under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, landlords are obligated to maintain rental properties in a condition fit for human habitation. Specifically, Section 91 mandates that landlords must ensure the dwelling is fit for human habitation both at the start and throughout the duration of the tenancy. Section 92 requires landlords to keep in repair the structure and exterior of the dwelling, including drains, gutters, and external pipes, and to maintain installations for the supply of water, gas, electricity, sanitation, space heating, and heating water. If a landlord fails to address severe damp and mold despite repeated requests, the tenant should notify the landlord in writing, keeping records of all communications. If the landlord remains unresponsive, the tenant can contact the local authority's Environmental Health department, which can inspect the property and issue improvement notices. Additionally, the tenant may apply to the court for an order requiring the landlord to carry out repairs. It's advisable to seek legal advice before considering actions like withholding rent or arranging for repairs independently, as these carry legal risks.","In Wales, under the Renting Homes (Supplementary Provisions) (Wales) Regulations 2022, particularly regulation 14, tenants have a responsibility to notify their landlords of any faults, defects, damage, or disrepair that they reasonably believe are the landlord's responsibility.

Given the severe damp and mold in your rental property, it is essential to notify your landlord as soon as reasonably practicable. This notification should be in writing, detailing the specific issues you're experiencing, including photographs or videos if possible.

According to regulation 14(1), once notified, the landlord has a duty to address these issues promptly. However, as highlighted in regulation 2, if the tenant believes that certain items or fixtures are not the landlord's responsibility (e.g., those listed in the inventory), they must carry out repairs or replacements within a reasonable timeframe.

It is also worth noting that Section 96(3) of the Renting Homes Act 2016 defines ""lack of care,"" which includes any act or omission by the tenant, permitted occupier, or visitor to the property that significantly contributes to the issue. If your landlord fails to address these concerns, you may need to consider taking further action.

Another critical aspect is the concept of ""fitness for human habitation."" Regulation 11 requires landlords not to require rent payments during days or part-days when the dwelling is unfit for human habitation due to a serious breach by the landlord (such as severe damp and mold).

If your landlord has failed to address these issues, you can take several actions:

1. **Document everything:** Keep a record of all correspondence with your landlord regarding the repairs, including dates, times, and details of conversations.
2. **Send a formal letter or email:** Reiterate your concerns and request that the necessary repairs be carried out immediately.
3. **Contact a mediator or housing ombudsman:** If you're unable to resolve the issue directly with your landlord, consider seeking assistance from a mediation service or an independent housing ombudsman.
4. **Seek professional advice:** Consult with a local solicitor specializing in tenancy law or a housing advisor for personalized guidance on how to proceed.

Remember that in Wales, there are specific laws and regulations in place to protect tenants from such issues. Don't hesitate to seek help if you're experiencing difficulties with your landlord.","['', "" Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, Section 91: Landlord's obligation: fitness for human habitation\r\n"", "" Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, Section 92: Landlord's obligation to keep dwelling in repair""]",5,True,"Repairs

Wales,"A retailer in Wales is found selling alcohol below the minimum unit price set by the Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018. They argue that discounts and promotions allow them to reduce prices. What does the Act stipulate regarding minimum alcohol pricing, and what penalties could the retailer face for non-compliance?","Under the Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018, it is an offence for alcohol retailers in Wales to sell alcohol below the applicable minimum price, regardless of discounts or promotions. The Act defines the minimum price using the formula M × S × V, where M is the minimum unit price (set at 50p), S is the percentage strength of the alcohol, and V is the volume in litres. Non-compliance can result in enforcement actions by local authorities, including the issuance of fixed penalty notices of £200 for each offence. Therefore, retailers must adhere to the minimum pricing regulations, as discounts and promotions do not permit selling alcohol below the established minimum price.","The Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018 sets a minimum unit price for alcohol in Wales, which is £48 per litre of alcohol. This means that retailers must sell alcohol at or above this minimum price to avoid breaching the legislation.

According to Section 4(1) of the Act, a retailer can only deduct discounts and promotions from the sale price if they are applied after the sale has been made. However, this provision was modified by the Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Regulations 2019, which state that retailers may apply discounts before the sale.

Section 4(2) of the Act states that a retailer must ensure that no alcohol is sold at or below the minimum unit price unless the discount or promotion has been applied to an existing stock. However, Section 5 of the Act allows for exceptions to this rule, such as where the retailer is selling alcohol in small quantities or as part of a pack.

If a retailer in Wales fails to comply with the minimum unit price legislation, they could face penalties under the Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Regulations 2019. Section 11(1) of the regulations states that a retailer who contravenes the regulations must be fined an amount not exceeding £2,000.

Furthermore, if a retailer is found to have breached the minimum unit price legislation repeatedly or intentionally, they could face more severe penalties, including unlimited fines and potential prosecution under the Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) Act 2018. Section 11(5) of the regulations states that a court may impose a fine not exceeding £10,000 on an individual who commits an offence under the regulations.

In addition to fines, retailers in Wales who fail to comply with the minimum unit price legislation could also face other penalties, such as:

* Prosecution: Retailers who breach the legislation could be prosecuted by the Crown Prosecution Service.
* Removal of licenses: In extreme cases, a retailer who repeatedly breaches the legislation may have their license to sell alcohol revoked.
* Civil penalties: A retailer could also face civil penalties from the Welsh Government or other authorities.

It is worth noting that these provisions were modified by the Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Amendment) (Wales) Regulations 2021, which revoked certain provisions of the legislation. However, these changes do not affect the core principles of the minimum unit price legislation.

In summary, retailers in Wales who fail to comply with the minimum unit price legislation could face fines up to £10,000, removal of licenses, prosecution, and other civil penalties.","['', ' Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018']",5,True,"This Statutory Instrument corrects an error made by S.I. 2021/1342 (W. 346) and is being issued free of charge to all known recipients of that Statutory Instrument.

Wales,"A homeowner in Wales wants to build a large extension to their property without applying for planning permission, arguing that it's within permitted development rights. Under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Wales) Order 1995 and recent amendments, what are the rules regarding extensions, and when is planning permission required?","Under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Wales) Order 1995, as amended, specific conditions allow certain extensions to be built without a formal planning application, known as permitted development rights. Below are the key provisions relevant to the homeowner’s question:\nRelevant Provisions for Extensions:\nVolume Limitations:\n                        * Terraced Houses or Properties on Article 1(5) Land: The cumulative volume of the extension must not exceed the volume of the original dwellinghouse by more than 50 cubic meters or 10% (whichever is greater).\n                        * Other Houses: The cumulative volume must not exceed 70 cubic meters or 15% (whichever is greater).\n                        * Absolute Limit: In all cases, the increase must not exceed 115 cubic meters.\nHeight Restrictions:\n                        * The height of the extension must not exceed the highest part of the existing roof.\n                        * For properties with a flat roof, the extension must not be taller than the height of the original dwellinghouse.\nProximity to Boundaries:\n                        * No part of the extension should be nearer to any highway than the nearest part of the original dwellinghouse unless the extension is at least 20 meters from the highway.\nDesignated Areas:\n                        * Properties in designated areas such as conservation areas, National Parks, or Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty have more restricted permitted development rights, potentially requiring formal planning permission even for smaller extensions.\nImportant Considerations:\n                        * Amendments: The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (Wales) Orders 2014 and 2019 introduce specific changes and clarifications but do not fundamentally alter the provisions related to standard extensions under Schedule 2, Part 1. The 2014 amendment refines some criteria for residential projects, while the 2019 amendment includes updates relevant to designated areas and certain types of land use.\n                        * Verification with Authorities: Due to potential nuances or recent legislative changes that could affect individual cases, consulting the local planning authority or a professional planner is crucial to confirm compliance with current regulations.","In Wales, a homeowner may be able to build an extension without applying for planning permission under certain circumstances. The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Wales) Order 1995 confers permitted development rights in respect of certain developments, including extensions.

However, the rules regarding extensions are not straightforward, and there is some confusion between the two orders mentioned in the question. 

The first order, mentioned in Document Number 1, amends Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 by inserting a new Part 12A (Emergency Development by Local Authorities). This part permits local authorities in Wales to carry out certain development in an emergency.

On the other hand, the second order, mentioned in Document Number 1, amends Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 by inserting a new Part 3A (Temporary Buildings and Changes of Use for Public Health Emergency Purposes). This part permits certain development in Wales, including extensions.

According to the second order, an extension is considered as ""temporary"" if it is built within the permitted development rights under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995. However, there are some conditions that need to be met for this to apply.

To qualify for temporary building rights, the extension must meet certain criteria, such as being in respect of a building wholly or mainly in Wales that is considered special architectural or historic interest. Additionally, the land must include the building and adjacent areas, which are required for preserving, providing access to, or managing the building.

However, the second order also provides an exception for extensions that exceed certain limits (Document Number 3). If a planning permission has been granted under the powers conferred by the 1990 Act for development any part of which is within the Order limits following its coming into force, then the construction, maintenance, use or operation of that development under the terms of the planning permission does not constitute a breach of the terms of this order.

Therefore, to determine whether planning permission is required for an extension in Wales, it's essential to check if the project falls within the permitted development rights under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 or if it exceeds certain limits. If the latter applies, then a planning permission must be obtained.

It's also worth noting that the rules regarding extensions can vary depending on the location of the property and any other relevant factors. It may be necessary to consult with a planning expert or local authority to determine whether an extension requires planning permission in a specific case.","['', ' The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, Schedule 2, Part 1\r\n', ' The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (Wales) Order 2014\r\n', ' The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (Wales) Order 2019']",5,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Wales,"A parent in Wales is seeking additional learning support for their child, who has been diagnosed with special educational needs (SEN). How does the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 protect the child’s right to education, and what steps should the parent take to ensure their child receives the necessary support?","The Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 provides a strong legal framework to protect the rights of children with special educational needs (SEN) in Wales, ensuring they receive appropriate education and support. Here's how the Act safeguards these rights and the steps parents should take:\nHow the Act Protects the Child’s Right to Education\n                           * Definition of Additional Learning Needs (ALN) (Section 2): The Act defines ALN as a learning difficulty or disability that requires additional learning provision. This ensures children who face significantly greater learning challenges than their peers or have disabilities affecting their use of educational facilities are identified and supported.\n                           * Individual Development Plans (IDPs) (Section 10): The Act mandates the creation of IDPs for children with ALN. These comprehensive, tailored plans detail the specific support required and are maintained by local authorities or educational institutions, guaranteeing that each child's unique needs are met.\n                           * Duties of Local Authorities and Schools (Sections 11 and 14): Local authorities and the governing bodies of maintained schools have a duty to identify children with ALN and make appropriate provisions. They must review these provisions regularly to ensure their effectiveness and adapt them as needed.\n                           * Participation and Rights (Section 6): The Act emphasizes involving children and their parents in the decision-making process regarding ALN support. Authorities must also consider the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, reinforcing a rights-based approach.\n                           * Access to Information and Advice (Section 9): The Act requires local authorities to provide parents with information and advice on ALN and the available support, empowering them to make informed decisions.\n                           * Dispute Resolution and Appeals (Sections 68 and 70): The Act establishes clear mechanisms for resolving disagreements. If parents are unsatisfied with the IDP or support provided, they can use local dispute resolution services. Additionally, they have the right to appeal decisions to the Education Tribunal for Wales.\nSteps Parents Should Take to Ensure Their Child Receives Support\n                           * Request an Assessment: Parents can request that the local authority assess their child for ALN. Although the Act does not explicitly state this in Section 11, it mandates that authorities and schools must decide if a child has ALN when concerns are raised.\n                           * Engage in the IDP Process: Actively participate in the development and review of the IDP. Ensure the IDP reflects the child's current needs and advocate for revisions as needed.\n                           * Utilize Available Resources: Make use of the information and advice provided by local authorities as mandated in Section 9. This will help parents understand their rights and the provisions their child is entitled to.\n                           * Address Disagreements: If there are concerns about the IDP or the support provided, use the dispute resolution mechanisms outlined in Section 68. For unresolved issues, parents can appeal to the Education Tribunal for Wales as outlined in Section 70.\n                           * Regularly Review the IDP: Ensure that the IDP is reviewed regularly, as mandated by the Act, to keep it aligned with the child’s evolving educational needs.\nThis framework ensures that children with SEN in Wales receive the educational support they require, and parents are empowered to advocate effectively for their child’s rights.","In Wales, the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 is a critical piece of legislation that protects the right to education for children with special educational needs (SEN). The Act establishes a statutory framework for supporting children and young people with additional learning needs, replacing the existing legislation surrounding special educational needs and the assessment of children with learning difficulties.

The key provisions in the Act ensure that every child with SEN has access to an effective education plan that meets their individual needs. This includes:

1. **An Education, Health and Care (EHC) Plan**: A tailored plan that outlines the child's needs, the support they require, and the services they need from the local authority.
2. **The Tribunal Process**: An independent process where parents or young people can seek a review of their EHC plan or make an application for support if the local authority refuses to provide it.

To ensure their child receives the necessary support, a parent in Wales should:

1. **Seek advice and guidance** from the local authority or an independent advocate, who can help them navigate the process.
2. **Provide detailed information** about their child's needs, including any relevant medical or educational history.
3. **Work with the local authority to develop an EHC plan**, which outlines the support required for their child.
4. **Request a review of the EHC plan** if they disagree with the content or the services provided.
5. **Seek mediation or Tribunal proceedings** if the issue cannot be resolved through discussions with the local authority.

The Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 provides a robust framework for supporting children with SEN, ensuring that their right to education is protected. By following these steps, parents can work collaboratively with the local authority to secure the best possible outcomes for their child.

It's also worth noting that the Act provides protections for children who are:

* **Under compulsory school age** but have identified special educational needs (as per Document Number 1).
* **Over compulsory school age and below**, who have certain identified special educational needs, and are educated at an independent school or home-educated (as per Document Number 2).

The Act ensures that these children receive the support they need to access education and participate fully in their community.","['', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 2: Definition of Additional Learning Needs (ALN)\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 6: Participation and Rights\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 9: Access to Information and Advice\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 10: Individual Development Plans (IDPs)\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 11: Duties to Decide: Maintained Schools and Further Education Institutions\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 14: Duties of Local Authorities and Schools\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 68: Dispute Resolution Mechanisms\r\n', ' Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018, Section 70: Appeals to the Education Tribunal for Wales']",5,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

Scotland,"An employee in Scotland has recently lost a child and is unsure of their entitlement to bereavement leave. Under the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018, what are their rights, and what obligations does the employer have?","Under the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018, incorporated into the Employment Rights Act 1996 and the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, employees in Scotland who have lost a child are entitled to specific rights, and employers have corresponding obligations. Section 80EA of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (as amended) grants eligible employees the right to take at least two weeks of parental bereavement leave. This leave must be taken within 56 days from the date of the child’s death and applies to the death of a child under 18. Section 80EE extends these rights to cases involving stillbirths after 24 weeks of pregnancy. Employers are obligated to provide this leave, ensuring that eligible employees can take time off without facing any detriment or dismissal related to their leave request. For statutory parental bereavement pay, Section 171ZZ6 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (as amended) outlines the entitlement, specifying that the employee must meet certain conditions such as a continuous employment period of at least 26 weeks ending with the ""relevant week"" (the week immediately before the child’s death) and minimum earnings meeting the lower earnings limit. Section 171ZZ7 adds that employees must give notice to their employer about the weeks for which they seek parental bereavement pay, and employers may require this notice in writing. Regulations under this section may also stipulate further requirements, such as providing evidence of entitlement or conditions for determining continuous employment. In addition to these primary sections, reviewing supporting regulations linked to the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018 and related guidance is essential for comprehensive compliance. Regulations detail how leave is to be taken, how statutory pay is processed, and additional procedural requirements for both employees and employers.","In Scotland, an employee who has recently lost a child is entitled to take parental bereavement leave under the Parental Bereavement Regulations 2020. 

To be eligible for this leave, the employee must satisfy one of the conditions specified in regulation 4(2) of the regulations. These conditions include being the parent of the deceased child, having been placed for adoption, being an adopter, or having a close relationship with the child.

For example, if the employee is the biological parent of the deceased child, they would satisfy one of the conditions under regulation 4(2)(a). If the employee was placed for adoption, but the placement has not been disrupted, as mentioned in regulation 3(3), they may also be eligible for bereavement leave.

The regulations do not specifically state that the employer must provide proof of the employee's relationship to the deceased child. However, under Scottish law, an adopter is considered a parent of the adopted child, and this status can be used as evidence of parental responsibility.

Once the employee has satisfied one of the conditions in regulation 4(2), they are entitled to take up to three days (or six days if the employee is eligible for bereavement leave under more than one child) of bereavement leave. The employer must not deduct any pay or deductions from the employee's wages during this time.

The regulations also state that the employer may require the employee to provide a death certificate and other documentation to support their claim for bereavement leave. However, it is worth noting that the regulations do not specify which types of documentation are required.

In terms of obligations, employers in Scotland have a duty of care towards their employees, including providing a safe and healthy work environment. The employer may also be liable under Scottish employment law if they fail to provide adequate support for an employee who has recently lost a child.

Employers must keep records of bereavement leave taken by employees and ensure that this information is kept confidential. They should also consider providing additional support to employees during this time, such as access to counseling services or flexible working arrangements.","['', ' 1.

Scotland,"A tenant in Scotland has reported significant dampness and mold in their rented flat to the landlord, who has not taken any action. Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, what are the landlord's obligations, and what steps can the tenant take to enforce these obligations?","Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, landlords are required to ensure that their rental properties meet the Repairing Standard, as defined in Section 13 of the Act. This includes ensuring that the property is wind and watertight, reasonably fit for human habitation, and that the structure and exterior are in a reasonable state of repair. Additionally, installations for the supply of water, gas, electricity, sanitation, heating, and hot water must be kept in proper working order. Significant dampness and mold indicate a failure to meet this standard. Under Section 14, landlords have a duty to ensure that the house meets the repairing standard at the start of the tenancy and throughout its duration. This duty requires landlords to complete any necessary repairs within a reasonable time after being notified by the tenant or otherwise becoming aware of the need for repairs. Failure to act within a reasonable timeframe constitutes a breach of this duty. If the landlord does not take action, the tenant can apply to the First-tier Tribunal under Section 22 of the Act. This section allows tenants to seek a decision from the Tribunal if the property does not meet the Repairing Standard. The Tribunal can investigate and issue a Repairing Standard Enforcement Order (RSEO) under Section 24, compelling the landlord to carry out the required repairs within a specified timeframe. If the landlord fails to comply with the RSEO, under Section 26, the Tribunal must notify the local authority and may consider imposing a rent relief order to reduce the tenant’s rent. The Tribunal may excuse non-compliance if the landlord demonstrates an inability to comply due to a lack of necessary rights (e.g., access) or if the required work poses a danger to any person. In such cases, the Tribunal must notify the local authority of its findings. The Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 provides tenants with clear mechanisms to address substandard housing conditions and enforce their rights against landlords who fail to fulfill their obligations. These regulations govern the procedures of the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland Housing and Property Chamber, which is responsible for handling cases brought under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, including applications related to the Repairing Standard. The regulations ensure that disputes between tenants and landlords are resolved fairly and efficiently. They outline the rules for submitting applications, conducting hearings, issuing decisions, and enforcing orders such as Repairing Standard Enforcement Orders (RSEOs). This procedural framework directly supports tenants in seeking remedies for landlords' failures to meet their legal obligations under the Act.","Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, landlords in Scotland have a range of obligations regarding the maintenance and repair of rental properties. One of these obligations is to ensure that private rental properties meet the ""tolerable standard,"" which includes requirements for fire and carbon monoxide detection and warning equipment.

In this case, where the tenant has reported significant dampness and mold in their rented flat, the landlord's primary obligation would be to take immediate action to address this issue. Specifically, they are required to:

1. Inspect the property: The landlord must inspect the property and determine the cause of the dampness and mold.
2. Take steps to remedy the problem: Based on the inspection, the landlord must take steps to remediate the problem, including any necessary repairs or maintenance.

Section 13(f) and (g) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 relate specifically to fire and carbon monoxide detection and warning equipment. However, as mentioned in Document Number 1, these subsections are being repealed by amendments introduced by the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 (Tolerable Standard) (Extension of Criteria) Order 2019.

Despite this, the landlord still has a general duty to ensure that their rental property meets the tolerable standard. This includes ensuring that the property is free from hazards such as dampness and mold.

If the tenant has already reported the issue to the landlord but they have not taken any action, the tenant can take steps to enforce their obligations under the Act. Specifically:

1. Request a written response: The tenant should request a written response from the landlord outlining what actions they plan to take to address the dampness and mold.
2. Escalate the issue: If the landlord's response is inadequate or non-existent, the tenant can escalate the issue to the local housing authority, such as the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS).
3. Seek a court order: In extreme cases, where the landlord has failed to take adequate action to address the dampness and mold, the tenant may seek a court order requiring the landlord to undertake specific repairs or maintenance.
4. Pursue compensation: The tenant may also be entitled to compensation under Scottish law for the harm caused by the landlord's failure to maintain a safe and habitable rental property.

It is essential for tenants in Scotland to familiarize themselves with their rights and obligations under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 and other relevant legislation. If you are facing similar issues, I recommend consulting with a housing expert or seeking advice from a local tenant organization.","['', ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 13: The Repairing Standard\r\n', "" Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 14: Landlord's Duty to Repair and Maintain\r\n"", ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 22: Application to the First', 'tier Tribunal\r\n', ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 24: Repairing Standard Enforcement Order (RSEO)\r\n', ' Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, Section 26: Effect of Failure to Comply with Repairing Standard Enforcement Order\r\n', ' Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014\r\n', ' First', 'tier Tribunal for Scotland Housing and Property Chamber (Procedure) Regulations 2017 https://www.legislation.gov.Unitedkingdom/ssi/2017/328/contents/made']",5,True,"3

Scotland,"An individual in Scotland is experiencing domestic abuse from their partner with whom they share a tenancy. They wish to remove the abuser from the home but are unsure of their rights. Under the Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021, what legal protections are available, and what steps should they take?","Individuals experiencing domestic abuse in Scotland can seek protection through several legal mechanisms. Under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, they can apply for a Non-Harassment Order, which prohibits the abuser from engaging in threatening or harassing behavior. Additionally, the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981 allows for an Exclusion Order to remove the abuser from the shared home and prevent them from re-entering. This Act applies not only to married couples but also to cohabitants. The individual should contact the police to report the abuse, as domestic abuse is a criminal offense under the Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2018, which recognizes controlling behavior as abuse. Seeking legal advice from a solicitor experienced in domestic abuse cases is advisable to assist with applications for protective orders, and engaging with support services such as Scottish Women's Aid can provide additional assistance and guidance.","Under the Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021, an individual experiencing domestic abuse from their partner may have several legal protections available to them.

Firstly, the Act provides a definition of ""abuse"" which includes behavior that is abusive towards a person who is in a relationship with the abuser. This definition is based on sections 2 and 3 of the Act, which describe what constitutes abusive behavior.

If an individual can prove that they have been subjected to abuse from their partner, they may be able to apply for a court order under section 14 of the Act, also known as "" Proceedings for recovery of possession or termination of joint tenant's interest"". This court order allows the victim to terminate their tenancy with the abuser and take possession of the home.

However, to qualify for this protection, an individual must meet certain conditions set out in section 2(1) of the Act. These conditions include:

* The individual is in a relationship with the abuser
* The abuser has engaged in behavior that is abusive towards them (i.e., behavior that meets the definition of ""abuse"" as described in sections 2 and 3 of the Act)
* The individual wishes to continue living in the home
* The abuser wishes to recover possession of the home from the individual

If an individual can meet these conditions, they should take the following steps:

1. **Document evidence of abuse**: Keep a record of any incidents of abuse, including dates, times, locations, and details of what happened.
2. **Seek support**: Reach out to organizations that specialize in domestic abuse for guidance, advice, and emotional support. These may include local support groups, counseling services, or national helplines.
3. **Apply for a protection order**: Depending on the nature of the abuse, an individual may be able to apply for a civil protection order (CPO) or a non-harassing communication order (NHCO). A CPO can provide temporary protection from the abuser, while an NHCO can limit the abuser's contact with the individual.
4. **Contact the housing authority**: Inform their housing authority about the domestic abuse and request assistance in terminating the tenancy with the abuser or finding alternative accommodation.
5. **Seek advice from a solicitor**: Consult with a solicitor who specializes in housing law or family law to understand the options available under the Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021.

Remember that individual circumstances can vary, and it's essential to seek personalized advice from a qualified professional before taking any action.","['', ' Protection from Harassment Act 1997\r\n', ' Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981\r\n', ' Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2018']",5,True,"Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021

(b)
take into account—
(i)
any views of which the senior constable becomes aware as a result of paragraph (a), and
(ii)
the welfare of any child whose interests the senior constable considers to be relevant to the making of the notice.
(5)
A domestic abuse protection notice may be made without the consent of person B.","{'category': 'Exclusively or primarily applies to Scotland', 'country': 'Scotland', 'file': 'Domestic Abuse (Protection) (Scotland) Act 2021.txt', 'legislation': 'Acts of the Scottish Parliament', 'url': 'https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2021/16/section/4', 'year': '2021'}","SCOTTISH STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS

","Under the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012, which amends the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, retailers in Scotland are required to sell alcohol at or above a minimum unit price (MPU) set by the Scottish Ministers. This rule applies to all licensed premises, including shops, bars, restaurants, and temporary events with occasional licenses. The minimum price condition is detailed in Schedule 3, Paragraph 6A for premises licenses and Schedule 4, Paragraph 5A for occasional licenses. Alcohol must be sold at a minimum price calculated by multiplying the MPU by the strength and volume of the alcohol. As amended by The Alcohol (Minimum Price per Unit) (Scotland) Order 2018, the current MPU is set at 65 pence per unit. Retailers must comply with this minimum price, and selling alcohol below this threshold constitutes a breach of licensing conditions. If a retailer fails to meet the minimum pricing requirement, Section 36 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 allows the licensing board to review the premises license and impose penalties as needed. Following a review, the board may suspend the license temporarily, revoke the license entirely, or modify the license conditions to enforce compliance. These penalties aim to uphold public health and ensure responsible alcohol sales.","Under the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012, retailers in Scotland have a legal obligation to ensure that alcohol is not sold on their premises at a price below the minimum unit price set by law. The current minimum unit price for Scotland is 50p per unit.

According to Section 1 of the 2012 Act, this mandatory condition of premises licences and occasional licences requires that all retail establishments selling alcohol must adhere to the minimum pricing provisions. This means that retailers who sell alcohol below the minimum unit price can face penalties from local authorities and Licensing Boards.

The penalties for non-compliance with the minimum unit price include:

* A fine of up to £2,500
* Up to 6 months imprisonment
* Revocation or suspension of their licence

In addition to these penalties, retailers who fail to comply with the minimum unit price may also be required to pay a penalty charge of up to £5,000. This amount can be increased by up to £10,000 for repeat offenders.

The Scottish Government has implemented measures to ensure compliance with the minimum unit price, including:

* Regular inspections and enforcement actions
* Mandatory training for licensees on the implementation and enforcement of the minimum pricing provisions
* Public education campaigns to raise awareness about the minimum pricing provisions

Retailers who sell alcohol below the minimum unit price can face serious consequences, including financial penalties, imprisonment, and damage to their reputation. Therefore, it is essential for retailers in Scotland to ensure that they comply with the minimum unit price requirements set out by law.

It's worth noting that the retailer's consideration of selling alcohol below the minimum unit price due to competitive pressures may not be a valid reason for non-compliance. The Act explicitly states that the sale of alcohol at prices lower than the minimum unit price is an offense, and retailers are required to ensure that they comply with this provision.

In summary, under the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012, retailers in Scotland have a clear obligation to adhere to the minimum unit price requirements. Failure to comply can result in severe penalties, including fines, imprisonment, and revocation of their licence.","['', ' Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, Schedule 3, Paragraph 6A ', ' Premises Licence Mandatory Conditions\r\n', ' Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, Schedule 4, Paragraph 5A ', ' Occasional Licence Mandatory Conditions\r\n', ' The Alcohol (Minimum Price per Unit) (Scotland) Order 2018 ', ' Minimum Unit Pricing for Alcohol in Scotland\r\n', ' Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, Section 36 ', ' Application for Review of Premises Licence:']",5,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order is made under section 2(2) of the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012 (“the 2012 Act”). It comes into force on 30 April 2024.
Section 1 of the 2012 Act inserted provisions into schedules 3 and 4 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, introducing a further mandatory condition of premises licences and occasional licences. The condition is that alcohol must not be sold on the premises at a price below its minimum price. These provisions are the “minimum pricing provisions”.
Section 2(1) of the 2012 Act provides that the minimum pricing provisions expire 6 years after section 1 of the 2012 Act came fully into force unless an Order is made under section 2(2) of that Act to continue the effect of those provisions. Section 1 of the 2012 Act came fully into force on 1 May 2018. This Order continues the effect of the minimum pricing provisions.

Scotland,"A parent in Scotland believes their child requires additional support in school due to a learning difficulty. Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 (as amended), what rights does the child have, and what steps can the parent take to secure the necessary support?","Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004, as amended, children in Scotland who require additional support due to learning difficulties are legally entitled to specific rights. Education authorities have a duty to assess and provide for these needs when required. According to Section 8(1), if a parent requests an assessment to determine whether their child has additional support needs or requires a Co-ordinated Support Plan (CSP), the education authority must comply with this request unless it is deemed unreasonable. Following assessment, Section 4(1)(a) requires the education authority to make adequate and efficient provision for the identified needs, which can include specialized resources or tailored teaching approaches. If a child’s support needs involve multiple agencies, such as social work or healthcare in addition to education, Section 9(1) ensures they are entitled to a CSP, a document outlining coordinated support across agencies. Parents also have the right, under Section 12(2), to be actively involved in developing and reviewing support plans to ensure that their child’s educational requirements are fully understood and addressed. If disagreements arise regarding the support provided or decisions made, Section 18(1) grants parents the right to appeal to the Additional Support Needs Tribunal for Scotland, which can make binding rulings on disputes related to additional support. These legislative provisions provide a strong framework for ensuring children’s educational needs are met and give parents a clear process to advocate for the support their child requires.","In Scotland, under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 (as amended), a child with a learning difficulty has several key rights that the parent should be aware of. 

Firstly, the child has the right to an assessment of their needs under Section 21A of the Act. This requires the local authority to assess whether the child is likely to benefit from additional support and to provide information about the assessment process.

Secondly, if the child's needs are identified, the local authority must provide a written statement outlining what support will be provided for the child (Section 20A of the Act). 

Thirdly, the child has the right to make representations during any dispute between them and their parents regarding the provision of the support (Section 29 of the Act).

Lastly, under Section 25 of the Act, parents have the right to appeal if they are dissatisfied with the assessment or support plan.

To secure additional support for their child, a parent can take several steps:

1. Request an Early Learning and Childcare Needs Assessment: The parent can request an Early Learning and Childcare Needs Assessment to identify the child's needs and determine the level of support required.
2. Meet with the Local Authority: The parent should meet with the local authority to discuss their concerns and ask for advice on how to secure additional support for their child.
3. Seek a Statement under Section 20A: If an assessment confirms that the child requires additional support, the parent can request a written statement outlining what support will be provided for the child.
4. Engage in Parent-Teacher Consultation: The parent should engage with teachers and other professionals to discuss their concerns and ensure that their child is receiving adequate support.
5. Consider Independent Advocacy: If necessary, the parent may want to consider independent advocacy services to help them navigate the system and advocate for their child's needs.

It's worth noting that parents have a duty of care under Scottish law to ensure their child receives a suitable education and to cooperate with the local authority in this regard (Section 13A of the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004).",['Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004'],5,True,"Prospective

NothernIreland,"An individual in NothernIreland is experiencing domestic abuse and seeks protection from their abuser. Under the Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (NothernIreland) 2021, what legal protections are available, and what steps should they take to secure those protections?","An individual in NothernIreland experiencing domestic abuse is protected under the Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (NothernIreland) 2021. Specifically, Section 1 of the Act criminalizes a course of abusive behaviour towards a person to whom the abuser is personally connected, such as a partner, ex-partner, or family member. The individual should report the abuse to the Police Service of NothernIreland to initiate a criminal investigation under this Act. Section 2 defines ""abusive behaviour"" as behaviour that is violent or threatening, or behaviour where a reasonable person would consider the course of behaviour likely to cause one or more of the following effects on the victim (B):
                                       * Making B dependent on, or subordinate to, A (the abuser);
                                       * Isolating B from friends, relatives, or other sources of social interaction or support;
                                       * Controlling, regulating, or monitoring B's day-to-day activities;
                                       * Depriving B of, or restricting, freedom of action;
                                       * Frightening, humiliating, degrading, or punishing B.
While the Act does not provide specific protective orders, the individual may apply for a Non-Molestation Order or an Occupation Order under the Family Homes and Domestic Violence (NothernIreland) Order 1998. A Non-Molestation Order can prohibit the abuser from molesting the applicant or a relevant child, and an Occupation Order can regulate the occupation of the shared residence. Additionally, Sections 25 to 28 of the Act offer special measures in civil proceedings to support victims, such as prohibiting the abuser from cross-examining the victim in person.
To secure these protections, the individual should:
                                       1. Report the abuse to the Police Service of NothernIreland to initiate criminal proceedings under the Act.
                                       2. Seek legal advice to apply for a Non-Molestation Order or an Occupation Order through the courts.
                                       3. Utilize the special measures provided in the Act during any civil proceedings to ensure their safety and well-being.","Under the Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (Northern Ireland) 2021, an individual in Northern Ireland experiencing domestic abuse may be eligible for various legal protections. The key protection provided is the domestic abuse protection order, which can prevent the abuser from contacting or approaching the victim.

To secure this protection, the individual should follow these steps:

1. **Seek advice from a solicitor**: It is recommended that the individual seek advice from a solicitor who specializes in family law and domestic violence cases. The solicitor will assess their situation and guide them on the best course of action.
2. **Apply for a non-molestation order (NMO)**: If the individual feels threatened or intimidated by their abuser, they can apply for a non-molestation order (NMO) under the Domestic Abuse Act 2021. This order will prevent the abuser from approaching, contacting, or pestering the victim.
3. **Apply for a domestic abuse protection order**: If the individual wants to prevent their abuser from contacting them directly, they can apply for a domestic abuse protection order (DAPO) under section 31 of the Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (Northern Ireland) 2021. This order will also prevent the abuser from approaching or disturbing the victim.
4. **Contact the police**: If the individual feels in immediate danger, they should contact the police without delay. The police can provide emergency protection and support.

It's essential to note that both NMOs and DAPOs are considered ""emergency"" measures, which means they can be granted immediately if the court is satisfied that there is an immediate risk of harm or intimidation.

In addition to these specific protections, individuals experiencing domestic abuse in Northern Ireland may also be eligible for other support services, such as:

* **Emergency accommodation**: Temporary accommodation can be provided to help the individual and their children escape the abusive situation.
* **Financial assistance**: Some organizations offer financial assistance to help the individual and their family members affected by domestic abuse.
* **Counseling and therapy**: Specialized counseling and therapy services are available to support individuals recovering from domestic abuse.

Overall, seeking advice from a solicitor and contacting the police or relevant authorities as soon as possible will be crucial in securing the necessary legal protections and support for individuals experiencing domestic abuse in Northern Ireland.","['', ' Domestic Abuse and Civil Proceedings Act (NothernIreland) 2021\r\n', ' Family Homes and Domestic Violence (NothernIreland) Order 1998']",5,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE

NothernIreland,"An employee in NothernIreland suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage. Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015, what are their rights, and what steps can they take to address the issue?","Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015, an employee in NothernIreland who suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage (NMW) has specific rights and actionable steps to address the issue. The Act mandates that employees must be paid at least the NMW, as set out in Section 1(1), which establishes the legal entitlement to minimum wage for all qualifying workers. Employers are legally required to keep accurate records of wage payments under Section 9 of the Act. These records should be sufficient to demonstrate that an employee is being paid at least the NMW. Therefore, the first step for the employee is to review their pay records to confirm any potential underpayment. Should there be a discrepancy, Section 10 grants the employee the right to formally request access to these records, enabling them to verify their calculations against the NMW requirement. If the employee identifies an underpayment, they should raise this issue with their employer, as it may be an oversight. If the employer fails to resolve the issue, the employee can escalate the matter to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the body responsible for enforcing compliance. While Section 13 of the Act authorizes the Secretary of State to appoint officers for enforcement purposes, Section 14 provides HMRC officers with the power to issue enforcement notices if employers are found non-compliant.  While the Act provides the primary framework, the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015 offer additional details for specific situations, such as valuing accommodation benefits or adjusting for absences, which can influence wage calculations. For most straightforward underpayment cases, the Act alone provides the necessary rights and procedures, with the Regulations supporting only in specific circumstances affecting wage calculation. In addition to these provisions, the Employment Rights (NothernIreland) Order 1996 is also relevant as it grants the employee a procedural framework for seeking redress if they are not compensated as per the NMW. Under the 1996 Order, if an employee experiences a sustained issue with underpayment, they have the right to file a claim with an Industrial Tribunal. This Order, though not specifically addressing minimum wage rates, is essential for the employee’s right to fair wages, as it permits claims for unlawful deduction of wages or breach of contract, allowing the employee to recover underpaid amounts. The 1996 Order thus complements the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 by establishing legal recourse in cases of wage disputes.","If an employee in Northern Ireland suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage, their first step should be to review the relevant regulations. The most recent amendments to the National Minimum Wage Regulations have been made through the ""The National Minimum Wage (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2024"" and ""The National Minimum Wage (Amendment) Regulations 2024"".

Under Section 21 of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, an employee who is paid below the National Minimum Wage has the right to claim compensation for any period during which they were underpaid. The employee should keep a record of their earnings, including dates and amounts paid.

To address the issue, the employee can take the following steps:

1. **Gather evidence**: Collect pay slips, receipts, or other documentation that proves their earnings below the National Minimum Wage.
2. **Contact HR or management**: Schedule a meeting with their employer to discuss the issue, providing evidence of underpayment.
3. **File a claim**: If the dispute is not resolved through discussion, the employee can file a claim for underpayment with the relevant authorities, such as Acas (Advice and Guidance on the National Minimum Wage), or directly with HM Revenue & Customs.
4. **Seek support**: Consider contacting a trade union representative or an employment law specialist for guidance on their rights and options.

It is essential to note that the employees should act promptly to maximize their chances of recovering underpaid wages.","['', ' National Minimum Wage Act 1998\r\n', ' National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015\r\n', ' The Employment Rights (NothernIreland) Order 1996']",5,True,"Prospective

NothernIreland,"An employee in NothernIreland has recently lost a child and is unsure about their entitlement to bereavement leave and pay. Under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022, what are their rights, and how can they access them?","Under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022, an employee in NothernIreland who has recently lost a child is entitled to bereavement leave, and if they meet certain criteria, they may also be eligible for bereavement pay. Article 112EA(1)-(3) defines a ""bereaved parent"" as an employee who meets specified relationship conditions with the deceased child, which may include a caregiving role before the child’s death. Employees who lose a child under 18, or experience a stillbirth after 24 weeks of pregnancy, are entitled to at least two weeks of bereavement leave under Article 112EA(5). This leave can be taken either as a single two-week block or in two separate one-week periods. According to Article 112EA(6), this leave must be taken within at least 56 days (eight weeks) from the date of the child’s death, providing flexibility within that period.
If an employee loses more than one child, Article 112EA(7) entitles them to bereavement leave for each child. Article 112EB outlines rights during and after bereavement leave, specifying that employees on leave retain most employment terms and conditions (excluding remuneration). According to Article 112EB(1)(a)-(c), employees are entitled to return to their original or an equivalent job after bereavement leave. Furthermore, Article 112EB(3) provides that if bereavement leave coincides with other types of parental leave (such as maternity or paternity leave), the right to return applies across the entire period of absence.
To access bereavement leave, Article 112ED(a) requires employees to notify their employer as soon as reasonably practicable, specifying the intended dates for leave. Employers are obligated to grant this leave and cannot delay or refuse it. If the employee is also eligible for statutory bereavement pay, they must provide notice and any required documentation as directed under Articles 112ED(a) and (c).","Given the employee's recent loss of a child, it is essential to understand their entitlements under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (Northern Ireland) 2022. 

Firstly, the employee has a statutory right to parental bereavement leave, which provides for up to two weeks' leave from work following the death of a child within the first 56 weeks after the child's death. This leave can be taken in one or two-week blocks and does not need to be consecutive.

To access this entitlement, the employee must meet the conditions outlined in regulation 4, which includes:

1. Being a bereaved parent (specifically, having a child who has passed away) 
2. Meeting specific substantive requirements, such as providing necessary information to their employer
3. Following the required notice procedures

The employee does not need to provide written notice but must give adequate notice before taking leave, depending on when it falls within 56 days of the child's death.

In addition to this statutory right, the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2022 also provide for contractual rights to parental bereavement leave. However, these regulations have been revoked by The Parental Bereavement Leave (No. 2) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2022.

As a result of this revocation, the employee's only entitlement is under the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (Northern Ireland) 2022.

To access their rights, the employee should:

1. Inform their employer as soon as possible about their bereavement
2. Provide necessary information to fulfill the substantive requirements outlined in regulation 4
3. Follow the notice procedures required under the regulations

It is recommended that the employee consults with HR or a relevant authority for more detailed guidance on accessing their entitlement, as well as any specific company policies regarding parental bereavement leave.

It's worth noting that separate impact assessments have been published for The Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2022 and the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, which can provide further information on how these regulations may affect employees.","['', ' Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022']",5,True,"EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers inserted into the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 (N.I. 16) (the “1996 Order”) by the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 (c. 5).
The Regulations revoke and re-enact the provisions of the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023 which would otherwise cease to have effect by virtue of Article 251(1A) of the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996.
These Regulations provide for a statutory entitlement for bereaved parents who are employees to take up to two weeks’ leave from their job called parental bereavement leave in the 56 weeks following the death of a child.
Part 2 relates to entitlement to parental bereavement leave. The right to take parental bereavement leave is conferred by regulation 4 which sets out the conditions for entitlement which must be satisfied by the employee in order to take parental bereavement leave. These include substantive requirements, such as the employee falling within the definition of a bereaved parent (in particular, specifying the types of parental relationships in respect of which the new entitlement arises), as well as procedural requirements, such as the employee giving appropriate notices to their employer. Where an employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave under regulation 4 as the result of the death of more than one child, the employee is entitled to parental bereavement leave in respect of each child.
Regulation 5 sets out the number of weeks of parental bereavement leave that are available to a bereaved parent and gives an employee the option of taking either one or two weeks’ parental bereavement leave. The weeks taken as parental bereavement leave do not need to be taken consecutively. It also provides that parental bereavement leave may only be taken within the period of 56 weeks beginning with the date of the child’s death.
Regulation 6 details the notice requirements and other information the bereaved parent must provide to their employer before taking parental bereavement leave. An employee does not need to provide notice in writing to his or her employer, but the length of notice required to book and cancel parental bereavement leave will vary depending on whether the period the employee intends to take as parental bereavement leave falls within 56 days of the child’s death or later. Regulations 7 and 8 respectively set out when an employee’s period of bereavement leave may start and what happens when a period of parental bereavement leave is interrupted by another type of statutory leave under Part 9 of the 1996 Order.
Part 3 contains provisions applicable in relation to the taking of parental bereavement leave. Regulation 9 elaborates on the new Article 112EB of the 1996 Order, by providing that an employee is entitled during his or her absence on leave to the benefit of all of his or her terms and conditions of employment apart from the right to remuneration (excluded by Article 112EB(2)(b)); also that the employee is subject to all of the obligations under those terms and conditions except in so far as they are inconsistent with the right to take parental bereavement leave (the exception appears in Article 112EB(1)(b)). Regulations 10 and 11 provide for an employee’s right to return to work after taking a period of parental bereavement leave, distinguishing the case where the leave was an isolated period of absence from the case where it followed another period of statutory leave. Regulations 12 and 13 provide that an employee entitled to parental bereavement leave is protected from detriment and dismissal attributable to the fact that they took or sought to take parental bereavement leave.
Part 4 contains provisions applicable where an employee has a contractual right to parental bereavement leave, in addition to the statutory right contained within these Regulations.
Part 5 (regulations 16 to 22) contains provisions in respect of the Transitional arrangements that will ensure a continuity of entitlement between the revoked Regulations and current Regulations. This part also contains the revocation of the Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023.

NothernIreland,"A tenant in NothernIreland has been served an eviction notice by their landlord, giving them four weeks to vacate the property. The tenant has lived there for two years under a periodic tenancy. Under the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, is the notice period valid, and what rights does the tenant have?","Under the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, a landlord’s notice to quit a property must meet specific statutory notice periods based on the length of the tenancy. This Act amends the Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006, particularly Article 14, to reflect updated notice requirements. For a tenant who has lived in the property for two years under a periodic tenancy, Section 11 of the 2022 Act amends Article 14 of the 2006 Order to specify that the landlord must provide at least 4 months’ notice before requiring the tenant to vacate. This 4-month period applies to tenancies that have existed for more than 12 months but not more than 3 years (as outlined in the new Article 14(1A)(b)). Because the landlord provided only four weeks’ notice, this does not satisfy the legal requirement, rendering the notice invalid. The tenant has the right to remain in the property until a valid notice to quit is served that meets the legally required notice period. Under Section 11 of the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, which amends Article 14 of the Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006, landlords are required to give a minimum 4-month notice for tenancies that have lasted more than 12 months but not more than 3 years. Because the tenant has lived in the property for two years, the landlord’s four-week notice does not meet this requirement and is therefore invalid. The tenant may choose to inform the landlord in writing that the notice is invalid due to the insufficient notice period, referencing Article 14(1), which states that a notice to quit is only valid if it complies with the minimum notice periods required by law. If the landlord proceeds with eviction attempts despite the invalid notice, the tenant may seek legal remedies. While specific injunctions or protections against harassment are not outlined within this tenancy legislation, the tenant may still seek legal assistance through broader NothernIreland housing or civil law protections to prevent an unlawful eviction and maintain peaceful possession of the property.","Under the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, the notice period of four weeks is not valid for a periodic tenancy that has been in place for two years or more. 

According to Schedule 1 of the Act, where the tenancy was granted on or after 30 June 2011 but before the date on which section 1 comes into operation (i.e., the date when section 2 of the Private Tenancies Act came into force), a tenant is entitled to a four-week notice period.

However, in this case, since the tenant has lived there for two years or more under a periodic tenancy, they are actually entitled to one month's notice. This means that the landlord's eviction notice with a four-week notice period is invalid.","['', ' Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022 ', ' Section 11\r\n', ' Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006 ', ' Article 14']",5,True,"Prospective

NothernIreland,"An individual in NothernIreland is being harassed and stalked by an ex-partner, causing them significant distress. Under the Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022, what legal protections are available to them, and what steps should they take to ensure their safety?","Under the Protection from Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022, individuals in NothernIreland who are being harassed and stalked by an ex-partner can rely on specific legal protections. The Act clearly defines stalking as a criminal offense in Section 1, where engaging in a course of conduct causing another person to experience fear, alarm, or substantial distress constitutes stalking. Such conduct includes following, contacting, monitoring usage of electronic communications, and other invasive behaviors. Offenders can face severe penalties, with up to 10 years imprisonment or a fine upon conviction on indictment, or up to 12 months imprisonment or a statutory maximum fine upon summary conviction. Additionally, the Act allows for Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs), detailed in Section 7, which the Chief Constable can apply for. These orders are designed to prevent further stalking activities by imposing specific prohibitions or requirements on the stalker. The eligibility for an SPO is based on evidence that the individual has engaged in stalking, poses a risk related to stalking, and that the order is necessary to protect someone from this risk. These orders can be applied against anyone residing in, or intending to visit, NothernIreland. The duration of these orders is addressed in Section 9, where an SPO can last for a minimum of two years or until further court order. The court may specify that some conditions within the SPO remain effective until further judicial review while setting others for fixed periods. This flexibility allows the protective measures to be adapted over time to match the needs of the situation. For their safety, affected individuals should report stalking incidents to the Police Service of NothernIreland (PSNI), enabling legal proceedings that could include the issuance of an SPO. Consulting legal advice and engaging with support services are also advisable steps to ensure comprehensive protection and support.","Under the Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, an individual being harassed and stalked by an ex-partner can seek protection through a Stalking Protection Order. This order provides a range of legal protections to help prevent further harassment and stalking.

To initiate this process, the individual should first contact the police and report the incidents of harassment and stalking. The police will then assess the situation and determine whether a Stalking Protection Order is warranted.

If the police decide that an order is necessary, they will issue a warning notice to the perpetrator, outlining the expected behavior and consequences for breaching the order. If the perpetrator fails to comply with the warning notice, they may be arrested and charged under section 6 of the Act.

The individual can then apply for a Stalking Protection Order through the Magistrates' Court. The court will consider the evidence presented by both parties and make a determination on whether the order should be granted.

If the order is granted, it will specify the behaviors that are prohibited towards the individual, such as approaching them within a certain distance or engaging in specific types of communication. Breaching this order can result in fines, imprisonment, or both.

In addition to seeking a Stalking Protection Order, the individual may also want to take other steps to ensure their safety. These could include:

* Changing their daily routine and habits to avoid encounters with the perpetrator
* Obtaining a restraining order from another jurisdiction if necessary
* Keeping a record of incidents and communication with the perpetrator
* Notifying friends, family, and colleagues about the situation and asking for their support
* Considering counseling or therapy to deal with the emotional impact of the harassment and stalking

It is essential to note that the individual should not attempt to take matters into their own hands or confront the perpetrator. This can escalate the situation and put them at greater risk.

Ultimately, the goal of a Stalking Protection Order is to provide the individual with a level of protection and security, allowing them to live without fear of harassment and stalking. By seeking this order and taking other necessary steps, the individual can take control of their safety and well-being.","['', ' Protection from Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022']",5,True,"Meaning of act associated with stalking and risk associated with stalking
