While the core answer was relevant, the extraneous information lowered the overall score.",1.0,The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions.,0.8218253968253969,"The score is 0.82 because the first five nodes in the retrieval context are highly relevant, directly addressing the legal protections under the Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, as seen in reasons like ""This document is the Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022"" and ""This section details the application process for Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs)"".  However, the lower ranking of irrelevant nodes, such as the sixth node with the reason ""This explanatory note refers to the Stalking Protection Act 2019, which is a different act than the one specified in the question."" and the eighth node with the reason ""This section refers to the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, which is not the act specified in the question."", slightly lowers the score.  The inclusion of these irrelevant nodes after several highly relevant ones reduces the contextual precision, but the majority of highly relevant information being ranked first maintains a strong score of 0.82.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the expected output is perfectly summarized by the retrieval context nodes.  All sentences in the expected output are fully supported by information found across multiple nodes in the retrieval context, specifically highlighting key sections (1, 6, 7, 9) and overarching aims of the Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022.",0.1111111111111111,"The score is 0.11 because the model largely aligns with the provided context regarding the Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, accurately describing its sections, application processes, and related legal provisions. However, a minor contradiction exists due to the context mentioning the Stalking Protection Act 2019, while the output focuses on the Northern Ireland act."
