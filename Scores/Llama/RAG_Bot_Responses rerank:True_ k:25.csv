1.0,"The individual in Northern Ireland should seek immediate legal advice and report the harassment and stalking to the police. The Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 provides a number of legal protections, including a stalking protection order that can prohibit the stalker from contacting the victim or being near their home. The police can also investigate the matter and take appropriate action, such as arresting the stalker.",0.9166666666666666,"The score is 0.92 because the 'actual output' incorrectly mentions a 'Protection from Harassment Order' (PHO), while the retrieval context only mentions 'Stalking Protection Orders'.",0.7202380952380952,"The score is 0.72 because the third, fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth, eleventh nodes are ranked lower than the first, second, fourth, seventh, tenth, and twelfth nodes as the former nodes mention legislation that is not relevant to the Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022, whereas the latter nodes mention specific provisions or the act itself, which are relevant to the user's question.",0.8846153846153846,"The score is 0.88 because sentences 1-7 are discussed in node(s) in retrieval context 1 and sentences 8-14 are discussed in node(s) in retrieval context 2, with sentences 15-18 not being mentioned in retrieval context. So, the score is not 1 due to the lack of information related to sentences 15-18 in the retrieval context.",0.16666666666666666,"The hallucination score is 0.17 because while the text mostly aligns with the context of the Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, it includes a few inaccuracies, mentioning 'Protection from Harassment Order' and 'Emergency Protective Order,' which are not present in the Act. These inaccuracies contribute to the score being slightly higher than 0."
