The seventh and eighth nodes are also less relevant as they focus on the coming into force date of the regulations, while the ninth, tenth, and eleventh nodes are all more relevant due to their discussions about the Secretary of State's power to prescribe regulations, and the Act's link to regulations governing the employee's rights.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because every sentence in the expected output relates to the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and Regulations, which are covered in the retrieval context.
