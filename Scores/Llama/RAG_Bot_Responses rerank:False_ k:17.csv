You are doing a great job understanding the context and providing accurate information.,0.8701082251082249,"The score is 0.87 because the top ranked nodes are all relevant to the topic of minimum wage regulations in Northern Ireland, while the irrelevant nodes are mainly focused on the citation and commencement date of the regulations, the extension to various parts of the UK, or specific regulations concerning family household work. These irrelevant nodes are less relevant to the user's query about rights and steps they can take to address an underpayment issue, and therefore should be ranked lower than the relevant nodes.",0.967741935483871,"The score is 0.97 because the provided context heavily covers the laws mentioned in the expected output, especially the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NothernIreland) 2015.

For example, sentences 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 all have strong support from node 4 in the retrieval context. While sentence 7 and 8 have strong support from node 1 in the retrieval context.
