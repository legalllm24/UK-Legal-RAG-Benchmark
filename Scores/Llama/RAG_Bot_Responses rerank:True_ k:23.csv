1.0,"The employee on maternity leave is entitled to various protections during redundancy, which should be considered by the employer in their redundancy process. Here's a breakdown of the key legal considerations and the employer's responsibilities: 

**Redundancy Protections for Maternity Leave:**

* **Right to Return:** The Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 guarantee the employee's right to return to her job after maternity leave.  This right applies even if the job is made redundant during her leave, as long as she meets the eligibility criteria. The employer must offer her a suitable alternative position if her original job no longer exists.

* **Priority for Suitable Alternative Roles:**  The employee has priority over other employees for any suitable alternative positions that become available within the company, even if they are outside her original department or location.  This principle aims to protect her career trajectory and employment opportunities during the redundancy process.

* **Consultation Requirements:** Employers have a legal obligation to consult with employees during a redundancy process, including those on maternity leave.  The employer must involve the employee in the consultation process, consider their individual circumstances, and make reasonable adjustments to accommodate her needs.

* **Fair Selection Criteria:** The employer must apply fair selection criteria to the redundancy process, taking into account the employee's skills, experience, and performance.  They should ensure that the process is transparent and objective.  Any discrimination based on pregnancy, maternity leave, or any other protected characteristic is unlawful under the Equality Act 2010.

**Health and Safety Considerations:**

* **Risk Assessment:** The employer must conduct a thorough risk assessment to identify any health and safety risks that might affect the employee's return to work. This assessment should be tailored to the employee's individual needs and potential vulnerabilities after maternity leave.

* **Reasonable Adjustments:** If the risk assessment identifies health and safety concerns, the employer has a legal duty under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 to make reasonable adjustments to the workplace or the employee's role to mitigate those risks.  This may include providing additional support, equipment, or training to ensure her safe return.

**Employer's Responsibilities:**

* **Open Communication:** The employer must keep the employee informed about the redundancy process, including any potential impact on her return to work.  This communication should be clear, concise, and timely.  The employer must be proactive in considering the employee's needs and proactively seeking solutions to potential challenges.

* **Individual Consultation:**  The employer must engage in a meaningful and individual consultation with the employee, even if the original job is no longer available. This consultation should explore potential alternative positions within the company that suit the employee's skills and experience. 

* **Good Faith:** The employer must act in good faith throughout the redundancy process and ensure that the employee is treated fairly and with respect.  This includes considering her rights and entitlements under the applicable legislation.  

**Case Law:**

Relevant case law provides guidance on the application of these principles in practical situations.  For example, courts have held that employers must consider the employee's right to return to work after maternity leave, even if her original job is no longer available, and that they must prioritize her for suitable alternative positions.   

**Conclusion:**

The employee on maternity leave has significant legal protections in place, including the right to return to work, priority for suitable alternative positions, and the right to be consulted during the redundancy process.  The employer has a duty to act fairly and reasonably, considering the employee's individual circumstances and ensuring her safety.
