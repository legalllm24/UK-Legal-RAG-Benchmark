They can access this leave by informing their employer of the death and providing evidence of the death, such as a death certificate. The employer can request additional information, such as a doctor's note, if they are concerned about the employee's ability to work. The employee does not need to use the leave all at once, they can take it in separate periods. They can also choose to take unpaid leave for a further 26 weeks.",1.0,This is perfect! You've got this!,0.6836676961905794,"The score is 0.68 because while the first few nodes focus on the relevant information on parental bereavement leave in Northern Ireland, the irrelevant nodes about revoking regulations appear later than they should. For instance, node 5 discusses the revocation of regulations and is irrelevant to the question, but it appears before node 2 which talks about the statutory entitlement for bereaved parents. Node 6 and 7 also talk about the revocation of regulations and are irrelevant, but they appear before nodes 3 and 4 which are relevant.  Node 10, 11 and 12 also discuss the revocation of regulations, and they appear before node 13 which is relevant.",0.0,"The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output are related to the information in the retrieval context, as the retrieval context does not mention the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022 or any of the Articles referred to in the expected output.

1.0,"The notice period is likely valid, and the tenant has limited rights. Under the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, a landlord can end a periodic tenancy with a four-week notice period. However, there may be exceptions or grounds for challenging the eviction, such as  discrimination or breach of contract. The tenant should seek legal advice to understand their specific rights and options.",1.0,"Amazing job! There are no contradictions, which means the output is perfectly faithful to the retrieval context.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because all the relevant nodes are ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. The first two nodes are relevant, providing information about the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022 and the notice periods required under it. The remaining nodes are all irrelevant as they discuss other acts, regulations, or aspects of the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022 that are not relevant to the tenant's situation. For example, the third node states ""This document primarily focuses on the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022 and does not provide specific information on the tenant's rights in this situation."", the fourth node focuses on an emergency period regarding notice periods, the fifth node discusses the Private Tenancies (Coronavirus Modifications) Act (Northern Ireland) 2020, and so on.

However, the summary includes an additional point regarding specific injunctions or protections against harassment which is not present in the retrieval context, hence the slightly lower score.",0.043478260869565216,"The hallucination score is 0.04 because the actual output is mostly aligned with the context, but it incorrectly states that the minimum notice period is four weeks, when it should be 12 weeks, as mentioned in the context.
