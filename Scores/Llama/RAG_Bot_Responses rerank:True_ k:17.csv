1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the response directly addresses the user's query regarding legal protections and safety measures under the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, providing relevant and accurate information.  There are no irrelevant statements.",0.8333333333333334,"The score is 0.83 because the actual output mistakenly describes Protection from Harassment Orders (PHOs), while the provided text focuses on Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs) under the Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, showing a mismatch in the information presented.",0.8303571428571428,"The score is 0.83 because the first four nodes in the retrieval context are highly relevant, correctly addressing the legal protections and steps available under the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022.  However, the fifth and sixth nodes are irrelevant, as they discuss information on when sections came into operation and amendments to criminal legal aid regulations, not providing answers to the question. The seventh node, while relevant, is quite broad; and the eighth node is again irrelevant, similar to the third node, focusing on a different act.  The ranking of these irrelevant nodes (3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th) after the highly relevant ones (1st, 2nd, 4th and 7th) leads to a score below 1.  The highly relevant nodes' reasons show this, providing specific details such as ""acts associated with stalking"", ""Applications for orders"", the ""Offence of stalking"", and the Act itself.  The irrelevant nodes, conversely, focus on unrelated legislation or procedural information such as amendment dates.",0.9090909090909091,"The score is 0.91 because the summary accurately reflects the Protection from Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022, aligning with information across multiple nodes in the retrieval context (nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5).  Sentences 1-4, 6, and 7-9 show strong alignment with the details of the act and SPOs in these nodes.  Sentence 10, while valuable advice, lacks explicit support within the provided nodes.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the generated text hallucinates information about Protection from Harassment Orders (PHO), which is not present in any of the provided contexts.  The contexts exclusively discuss the Stalking Protection Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 and Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs), demonstrating a significant factual mismatch and complete lack of alignment."
