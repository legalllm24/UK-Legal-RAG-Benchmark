1.0,"The tenant is concerned about their safety due to a malfunctioning carbon monoxide alarm that has not been repaired after three weeks. This is a serious issue, and the tenant is well within their rights to take action.  Under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (Amendment) Regulations 2022, the landlord is legally obligated to ensure that the alarm is working properly.  The tenant has already fulfilled their responsibility by notifying the landlord of the problem.  Therefore, the landlord is in breach of their legal obligations.  The tenant has several options available to them:  1. **Contact the local authority:**  The tenant can contact the local authority, which has the power to enforce the regulations and issue fines to the landlord. 2. **Take legal action:**  The tenant can sue the landlord in court to force them to repair or replace the alarm.  The tenant can also sue the landlord for damages for the period during which the alarm was malfunctioning. 3. **Use a tenancy deposit scheme:**  The tenant can deduct the cost of repairing or replacing the alarm from their tenancy deposit.  However, the tenant should first make sure they are entitled to do so under the terms of their tenancy agreement. 4. **Move out:**  If the landlord fails to address the problem, the tenant may have grounds to terminate their tenancy agreement and move out.   Ultimately, the best course of action for the tenant will depend on their specific circumstances.  They should carefully consider all options before taking any action.

1.0,"The local authority has a legal obligation under the Environment Act 2021 to implement separate food waste collections.

The Act also requires local authorities to ensure that the food waste collected is treated in a way that meets certain environmental standards. The deadline for complying with the Act's requirements has passed, and there is no plan in place. This means that the local authority is in breach of its legal obligations. Residents can use a number of legal remedies to enforce compliance with the Act. These include: 

* Judicial review: Residents can apply for judicial review of the local authority's decision not to implement separate food waste collections. This is a process where a court can review the legality of a decision made by a public body. 

* Statutory nuisance: If the local authority's failure to implement separate food waste collections causes a statutory nuisance, residents can take action under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. This includes taking action in the Magistrates Court. 

* Human rights claim: The European Convention on Human Rights guarantees the right to live in an environment which is not harmful to health or well-being. Residents could argue that the local authority's failure to implement separate food waste collections is a breach of this right. They could take action in the courts to enforce their rights.
