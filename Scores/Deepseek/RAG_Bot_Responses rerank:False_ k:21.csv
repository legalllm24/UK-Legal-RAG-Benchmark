The tenant should seek legal advice from a qualified professional to determine their specific rights and options.",1.0,"This is fantastic! There are no contradictions, so the actual output is perfectly faithful to the retrieval context!",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because all three nodes in retrieval contexts are relevant to the input. All three nodes directly address the question, with the first node providing the legal requirement for the notice period and the second and third nodes clarifying the consequences of the insufficient notice period and the tenant's rights, respectively. This indicates that the relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes, resulting in a perfect score.",0.9285714285714286,"The score is 0.93 because the provided information closely matches the retrieval context, specifically node(s) in retrieval context related to Article 14 of the Private Tenancies (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 and the legal requirements for notice periods.  Most sentences in the expected output directly correlate with these aspects, while only one sentence regarding specific injunctions or protections against harassment, is not directly addressed in the retrieval context.  However, this doesn't detract too much from the overall understanding of the text.",0.22727272727272727,"The score is 0.23 because while the output largely aligns with the context regarding the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, it does not accurately reflect the content relating to the Private Tenancies (Coronavirus Modifications) Act (Northern Ireland) 2020. It fails to mention the specific change in the notice to quit period and misses details regarding the specified circumstances for evictions. Additionally, it doesn't accurately address the specific expiration dates of the regulations. The output shows strong understanding of the 2022 Act but lacks complete accuracy regarding the 2020 Act, leading to a moderate hallucination score."

No contradictions found, it's a perfect match!",0.8217057743843458,"The score is 0.82 because the first 13 nodes in retrieval contexts provide relevant information about the 'Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022', while some nodes focus on different Acts like 'Protection from Harassment (Northern Ireland) Order 1997', 'Stalking Protection Act 2019 (c. 9)', and 'Stalking Protection Act 2019' in the 3rd, 8th, 17th, 20th, 21st, and 23rd nodes, which should be ranked lower than the relevant ones.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because all the information provided in the expected output is directly supported by the node(s) in retrieval context, specifically the first node.",0.0,The hallucination score is 0.00 because the output aligns with the provided contexts and does not contain any factual errors.
