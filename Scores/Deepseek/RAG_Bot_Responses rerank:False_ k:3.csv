1.0,"The employee has several legal protections during the redundancy process, and the employer must follow specific procedures to ensure fairness and compliance with relevant legislation. Here's a breakdown of the protections and procedures: 

**Protections during Redundancy:**

* **Maternity Leave Protection:** Under the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999, an employee on maternity leave is protected against dismissal (except in certain limited circumstances) for a period of 26 weeks after the end of her maternity leave. This protection applies to both redundancy and any other reason for dismissal. Therefore, the employee is likely protected against redundancy until at least 26 weeks after her maternity leave ends. The employer must consider alternatives to redundancy for the employee and make reasonable adjustments to allow her to return to work safely. 

* **Equality Act 2010:** This act prohibits discrimination on various grounds, including pregnancy and maternity. The employer must ensure that the redundancy process is fair and does not discriminate against the employee based on her maternity status.  They must consider all employees fairly for redundancy, regardless of their leave status. 

* **Health and Safety:** Under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, employers have a duty to ensure the health and safety of all employees. If there are health and safety concerns at the workplace that might affect the employee's return, the employer must address these concerns before the employee's return. This could involve implementing reasonable adjustments to the workplace or the employee's role to ensure her safety. 

**Employer's Procedures:**

* **Consultation:** The employer must consult with the employee (or her representative) about the redundancy process and explore alternatives to redundancy. This consultation should be meaningful and involve a genuine attempt to find alternative solutions. 

* **Fair Selection:** The employer must ensure that the selection criteria for redundancy are fair and objective. The criteria should be applied consistently to all employees considered for redundancy.  

* **Information and Support:** The employer should provide the employee with clear and concise information about the redundancy process, including the reasons for redundancy, the selection criteria, and any support available to her (such as outplacement services or redundancy payments).  

**Case Law:** There are many relevant cases relating to redundancy, maternity leave, and health and safety.  Case law can provide guidance on the specific legal obligations of the employer in this situation. For instance, the case of **[Case Name]** established that...

**Key Considerations:**

* **Reasonable Adjustments:**  The employer must consider reasonable adjustments to the workplace or the employee's role to accommodate her return after maternity leave. These adjustments could involve flexible working arrangements, changes to the employee's job duties, or modifications to the workplace. 

* **Return to Work Plan:** The employer should work with the employee to develop a return to work plan that addresses any health and safety concerns. This plan should be discussed and agreed upon with the employee and include specific measures to mitigate risks. 

**Conclusion:** The employee is entitled to significant protections during redundancy. The employer must follow a fair and transparent redundancy process, considering the employee's maternity leave status, health and safety concerns, and any relevant legal obligations.  The employer should engage in a meaningful consultation with the employee, explore alternatives to redundancy, and provide appropriate support to her throughout the process. The employer should also take steps to address any health and safety concerns before the employee's return to work.",0.9090909090909091,"The score is 0.91 because the actual output mentions 'Parental Bereavement Leave Regulations 2020', which is not found in the retrieval context.

Here's a breakdown of their rights and actions they can take:

**Rights of the Employee:**

* **Right to be paid at least the National Minimum Wage (NMW):**  The NMW is the minimum hourly wage that all employees in Northern Ireland are legally entitled to receive. The specific rate varies depending on the employee's age. 
* **Right to be paid for all hours worked:** This includes time spent on training, travel time if it's a requirement of the job, and any other time spent working for the employer.
* **Right to receive accurate payslips:** Payslips must show the employee's total hours worked, gross pay, deductions, and net pay. They must also include the National Minimum Wage rate that applies to the employee.
* **Right to written information about their employment:** This includes details about their job, pay, hours, and other relevant information. 
* **Right to raise concerns with their employer:**  The employee has the right to discuss their pay concerns directly with their employer.
* **Right to report non-compliance to authorities:**  The employee has the right to report any potential breaches of the NMW to the relevant authorities (see below).

**Steps the Employee Can Take:**

1. **Gather Evidence:** Collect any evidence that supports their claim, such as payslips, time sheets, contracts, emails, or notes documenting discussions about their pay.  
2. **Speak to the Employer:**  The employee should attempt to address the issue directly with their employer.  A clear and calm explanation of the situation, supported by evidence, may lead to a resolution.
3. **Contact the Labour Relations Agency (LRA):**  The LRA is the government body responsible for enforcing employment law in Northern Ireland. They can provide advice and support to employees about their rights, and they can investigate complaints about underpayment.
4. **Contact ACAS:**  The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) can offer free, confidential advice and assistance in resolving employment disputes, including those relating to pay.
5. **Consider Legal Action:** If all other options have been exhausted, the employee may consider legal action to recover unpaid wages.

**Important Notes:**

* **Time Limits:** There are time limits for bringing claims related to NMW violations.  It's essential to seek advice from the LRA or ACAS as soon as possible.
* **Anonymity:** The LRA can investigate complaints anonymously if the employee wishes to remain anonymous.
