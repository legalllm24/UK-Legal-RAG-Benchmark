1.0,"The notice period is likely invalid. Under the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, a landlord must give a tenant at least four weeks' notice to end a periodic tenancy, and the tenant must have lived in the property for at least six months.  Since the tenant has lived in the property for two years, the landlord must give at least four weeks' notice. However, the landlord has only given the tenant four weeks to vacate. This means the notice period is invalid. The tenant can apply to the Tenancy Tribunal for an order preventing their eviction. The tribunal will likely order the landlord to give the tenant a valid notice period. The tenant can also file a complaint with the Housing Executive if they feel their landlord is acting unfairly.",1.0,The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions.  You're doing a great job!
