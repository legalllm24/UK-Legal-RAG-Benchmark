1.0,"The apprentice has a right to be paid at least the National Minimum Wage (NMW) for their age, regardless of their apprenticeship status.  The employer is legally obligated to pay the NMW for workers over 19, even if they are apprentices. 

Since the apprentice is over 19 and has completed their first year of apprenticeship, they are entitled to the NMW for their age. The employer's continued payment of the lower apprenticeship wage violates the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and Regulations. 

The apprentice can take the following steps:

1. **Speak to the employer:** The apprentice should first try to resolve the issue directly with their employer by explaining their right to the NMW. 
2. **Contact ACAS:** The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) is an independent body that provides advice on employment issues. They can assist the apprentice in understanding their rights and advise on how to approach the employer. 
3. **Make a claim to HMRC:** The apprentice can file a claim with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for the difference between the NMW and the amount they were paid. HMRC has the power to investigate the employer and enforce payment. 
4. **Consider legal action:**  If other measures fail, the apprentice could consider taking legal action against the employer. This could involve claiming back lost wages and potentially seeking compensation for the employer's breach of contract. 

It is important for the apprentice to document all communication with the employer, including any attempts to raise the issue of their wages.

The thirteenth node deals with rent variation notice, not directly related to the eviction notice period.",0.75,"The score is 0.75 because the majority of the sentences in the expected output rely on the information presented in the 1st node in the retrieval context, specifically focusing on 'Article 14' of the 'Private Tenancies (Northern Ireland) Order 2006' and how it's amended by 'Section 11' of the '2022 Act'. However, the final sentence regarding broader NothernIreland legal protections for unlawful eviction does not directly correspond to the retrieval context, leading to a score of 0.75.",0.3076923076923077,"The score is 0.31 because the provided text contains contradictions with the context, particularly regarding the specified circumstances for attendance at a dwelling-house and the notice period, which leads to some level of hallucination."
1.0,"The individual should contact the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) immediately to report the stalking and harassment. The PSNI will investigate the matter and may obtain a Stalking Protection Order (SPO) on the victim's behalf. They can also apply for a Non-molestation Order (NMO) to prevent the ex-partner from contacting or approaching the victim. The victim should also gather evidence of the stalking and harassment, such as text messages, emails, or social media posts. They should also seek support from a local support organization, such as Women's Aid or the Men's Advice Line.",1.0,This is looking great! No contradictions found - keep up the good work!,0.7947781385281386,"The score is 0.79 because the first two nodes provide information directly related to the question, while the third node, focusing on the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, is not directly related to the input and should be ranked lower. Similar issues exist with the sixth and twelfth nodes, as they are not relevant to the question about legal protections in Northern Ireland. The remaining nodes are all relevant and provide valuable information on the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 and its application in the context of the input.",0.9333333333333333,"The score is 0.93 because sentences 1-14 of the expected output are supported by node(s) in retrieval context, but no sentences are directly supported by any single node.  The reason is that, while no sentence from the expected output is perfectly matched, the retrieved context is well-structured and relevant to all of the expected output sentences.",0.0,"The score is 0.00 because the actual output aligns with the context with no contradictions, with slight simplification in its explanation of the content."
