1.0,"The employee on maternity leave in England enjoys various legal protections during redundancy. Under the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999, she is entitled to be treated no less favorably than other employees during redundancy, including being considered for alternative roles.  The Equality Act 2010 further protects her from discrimination during the redundancy process, meaning she cannot be dismissed simply because she is on maternity leave. The employer must engage in a fair redundancy process, considering her suitability for alternative roles and her right to return to work. The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 require the employer to take reasonable steps to ensure her safety during redundancy processes. This may include adapting working arrangements or postponing the redundancy process until her return from maternity leave, depending on the nature of the health and safety concerns.  Additionally, the employer must provide her with detailed information about the redundancy process and her rights, including the right to appeal against the decision.

Under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm (Amendment) Regulations 2022, the landlord is required to repair or replace a faulty alarm within a reasonable timeframe.

* **Right to Seek Back Pay:** If an employee has been underpaid, they have the right to claim back the difference between the actual wage they received and the National Minimum Wage. This claim can be made for a period of up to six years from the date the underpayment occurred.  
* **Right to Make a Complaint:**  If an employee believes they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage, they can make a complaint to their employer or to the Department for the Economy (DfE) in Northern Ireland.

**Steps to Take:** 

1. **Gather Evidence:** The employee should gather evidence to support their claim, such as payslips, contracts, and any other documentation that shows their hours worked and the pay they received.  
2. **Contact Their Employer:** The employee should first try to resolve the issue with their employer. They can raise the issue with their manager or human resources department.  
3. **Contact the Department for the Economy (DfE):** If the employee is unable to resolve the issue with their employer, they can contact the DfE to make a complaint. The DfE has a dedicated team that handles complaints about National Minimum Wage violations.  
4. **Seek Legal Advice:**  If the employee is unable to resolve the issue with their employer or the DfE, they should seek legal advice from a solicitor or employment law specialist.  

**Note:**  It's important for the employee to remember that they are not alone and that there are resources available to help them. The DfE provides information and support to employees who are being paid below the National Minimum Wage.

1.0,"The notice period is likely invalid. The Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 requires a minimum notice period of 8 weeks for periodic tenancies unless the tenancy agreement states otherwise. This tenant has lived there for 2 years under a periodic tenancy, meaning the Act applies. Therefore, the 4-week notice period is too short.  The tenant should consult with a legal professional or housing advice service to fully understand their rights. ",1.0,This is perfect! I see no contradictions at all.
