Additionally, the second node focuses on amendments to the Employment Rights Act 1996 related to redundancy and dismissal during maternity, adoption, and shared parental leave, but doesn't provide detailed information on the specific protections available to an employee on maternity leave during a redundancy process, particularly concerning health and safety concerns. Moreover, the third node is an Explanatory Note and does not provide specific details about the protections for an employee on maternity leave during redundancy, only mentioning that the amendments extend requirements to employers in such situations. Similar issues occur with the fourth node. The fifth node focuses on an amendment to section 105 of the Employment Rights Act 1996, regarding redundancy and dismissal, but doesn't directly address the specific rights of an employee on maternity leave during a redundancy process.

1.0,"The landlord has a legal obligation to ensure that the carbon monoxide alarm is in working order.  Under the Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm Regulations 2015 (as amended), landlords are required to install and maintain a working carbon monoxide alarm in any rented property with a solid fuel heating appliance, such as a fireplace, wood-burning stove, or gas boiler. The landlord is also responsible for replacing any faulty alarm.  As the landlord has failed to repair or replace the malfunctioning alarm after three weeks, the tenant can take the following actions: 1.  Send the landlord a formal written notice detailing the problem and requesting that they take action to rectify the situation. This notice should be sent via recorded delivery, so the tenant has proof of delivery. 2.  If the landlord fails to take action within a reasonable timeframe, the tenant can report the issue to the local council.  The council has the power to issue a notice to the landlord requiring them to comply with the regulations. 3.  If the landlord continues to fail to comply, the council can take legal action against them, which could include a fine.  In addition to these actions, the tenant may also be able to claim compensation from the landlord for any losses incurred as a result of the faulty alarm, such as any costs of staying in alternative accommodation or any medical expenses incurred.

The fourth retrieval context node confirms that the relevant time period is 'more than 12 months but not more than 3 years'.

The sixth retrieval context node confirms the tenant's right by stating 'The tenant has the right to remain in the property until a valid notice to quit is served that meets the legally required notice period.'. The seventh retrieval context node directly answers the question by stating 'Under Section 11 of the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, which amends Article 14 of the Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006, landlords are required to give a minimum 4-month notice for tenancies that have lasted more than 12 months but not more than 3 years.'. The eighth retrieval context node confirms the tenant's right by stating 'Because the tenant has lived in the property for two years, the landlord’s four-week notice does not meet this requirement and is therefore invalid.'. The ninth retrieval context node provides relevant advice by mentioning 'The tenant may choose to inform the landlord in writing that the notice is invalid due to the insufficient notice period, referencing Article 14(1), which states that a notice to quit is only valid if it complies with the minimum notice periods required by law.'. The tenth retrieval context node provides relevant legal advice by stating 'If the landlord proceeds with eviction attempts despite the invalid notice, the tenant may seek legal remedies.'.
