1.0,"The landlord has a legal obligation to ensure that the carbon monoxide alarm is in proper working order. This includes repairing or replacing a faulty alarm within a reasonable timeframe. In this case, three weeks is likely to be considered unreasonable, as the tenant's safety is at risk. The tenant can take the following actions:

* **Contact the landlord again:** Remind the landlord of their legal obligation to fix the alarm and reiterate the safety concerns. Send the communication in writing (e.g., email, letter) for evidence. 
* **Report the issue to the local council:** Councils have the power to investigate and enforce housing standards. They can take action against the landlord if they find the alarm is not working. 
* **Consider withholding rent:** In some cases, a tenant may be able to withhold rent as a last resort if the landlord fails to fulfill their legal obligations. However, it's important to consult with an expert on housing law to determine whether this is an appropriate action in this specific case. 
* **Seek legal advice:** If the landlord fails to take action after repeated requests, the tenant can consult with a solicitor or housing advice service for legal guidance on how to proceed. 

The tenant should document all communication with the landlord, including any repairs attempted and their concerns. This evidence will be crucial in case the tenant needs to escalate the issue to the local council or seek legal advice.
