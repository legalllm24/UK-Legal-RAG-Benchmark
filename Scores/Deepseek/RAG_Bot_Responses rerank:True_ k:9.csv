1.0,"An employee in Northern Ireland who suspects they are being paid below the National Minimum Wage has several rights and can take steps to address the issue. Here's a breakdown based on the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2015:

**Rights:**

* **Right to be paid at least the National Minimum Wage:**  Employees are entitled to a minimum hourly wage that depends on their age. This wage is set by the government and is reviewed periodically.
* **Right to receive payslips:** Employers must provide payslips that clearly show the employee's gross pay, deductions, and net pay. The payslip should also indicate the National Minimum Wage rate applicable to the employee.
* **Right to work in a safe and healthy environment:** Employers are responsible for ensuring a safe and healthy workplace for all employees.
* **Right to be treated fairly and with dignity:** Employees have the right to be treated with respect and dignity by their employer. Discrimination based on age, gender, religion, or other protected characteristics is illegal.

**Steps to Take:**

1. **Keep Records:**  Gather any evidence you have that you are being paid below the National Minimum Wage, such as payslips, contracts, or email correspondence.
2. **Speak to Your Employer:** The first step is to raise the issue with your employer directly.  It's best to be polite but firm and ask for an explanation of why your pay is below the minimum wage.
3. **Contact ACAS:** The Advisory, Conciliation, and Arbitration Service (ACAS) provides free and impartial advice and support on employment issues. ACAS can assist with understanding your rights and options.
4. **Consider Making a Claim:** If you've exhausted other options and believe your employer is intentionally underpaying you, you can file a claim with the Department for the Economy (DfE) in Northern Ireland.  
5. **Seek Legal Advice:** If your claim is complex or involves legal issues, it's recommended to seek advice from a solicitor specializing in employment law.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Time Limits:** There are strict time limits for filing claims with the DfE. Make sure you're aware of these deadlines.
* **Statute of Limitations:** There is a statute of limitations on how long you can claim back underpayment, so it's crucial to act promptly.
* **Record Keeping:**  Always keep detailed records of your pay and working hours to support your claim.

**Additional Resources:**

* **Department for the Economy (DfE) Northern Ireland:** [https://www.economy-ni.gov.uk/](https://www.economy-ni.gov.uk/) 
* **Advisory, Conciliation, and Arbitration Service (ACAS):** [https://www.acas.org.uk/](https://www.acas.org.uk/)

Sentence 7 talks about the employee returning to their original or an equivalent job, which is consistent with the retrieval context, but not mentioned in the same way. Sentence 8 mentions Article 112EB(3) which is not mentioned by the retrieval context at all. Finally, the retrieval context does not mention any notification requirements, which are mentioned in Sentence 9. The retrieval context does not mention any required documentation, which is mentioned in Sentence 10. However, some information in the retrieval context does align with some parts of the expected output (such as the description of leave for multiple children and the return to work rights), but the retrieval context is overall fairly different from the expected output, giving a lower contextual recall score.",0.42857142857142855,"The hallucination score of 0.43 is because the actual output shows strong alignment with several key aspects of the provided contexts, including the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, the relevant Bill impact assessment date, and specific legal articles. However, it misses crucial information about the revocation of Regulations 14 and 15, which are explicitly mentioned in the provided contexts. This omission contributes to the score being neither extremely high nor low."
1.0,"The notice period is valid. Under the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, a landlord can terminate a periodic tenancy by giving the tenant four weeks' notice. This is in line with the legislation, so the notice period is valid. The tenant has the right to appeal the notice to the Residential Tenancies Authority (RTA) if they believe there are grounds for doing so. For example, if they believe they have been discriminated against or the notice is unreasonable, they can appeal to the RTA.",1.0,"This is fantastic! No contradictions detected, which means the output perfectly matches the retrieval context. Keep up the great work!",0.7,"The score is 0.70 because the first node is relevant, but the second, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth nodes are irrelevant. The first node is the most relevant since it mentions the 'Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022' and the length of notice required. The second node is about granting a private tenancy, which is not relevant to the provided output. The third node focuses on variation of a private tenancy, which is irrelevant. The fourth node deals with landlord's notice of termination in Wales, not Northern Ireland, making it irrelevant. The sixth node is also about landlord's notice in Wales, irrelevant. The seventh node explains the purpose and content of regulations, which are not directly relevant. The eighth node specifies the time limit for withdrawal notice by joint contract-holders, unrelated to the provided output. The ninth node covers notice regarding certain past matters to tenants, not directly related to the provided output. ",0.7692307692307693,"The score is 0.77 because the retrieval context primarily focuses on the notice periods required by the Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022, particularly the amendment of Article 14 in the Private Tenancies (NothernIreland) Order 2006. This aligns with the expected output's mention of the 2022 Act's amendments to Article 14, especially sentences 1-3 and 7. However, the retrieval context doesn't specifically address the tenant's right to remain, injunctions, or broader legal protections, which are mentioned in sentences 4, 9, and 10 of the expected output.",0.4444444444444444,"The hallucination score is 0.44 because the output contains factual contradictions, such as mentioning 'Schedule 1' and a minimum notice period of 6 months, which are not mentioned in the provided context. Additionally, the output does not mention a commencement date or a minimum time period for withdrawal notice, which are explicitly stated in the context."
0.8,"The score is 0.80 because the JSON output is correct, but doesn't directly address the legal protections available under the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 or steps to ensure safety. It mentions other related legislation, which are not relevant to the specific question asked.",1.0,This output is excellent! It's faithful to the retrieval context. ,0.9666666666666666,"The score is 0.97 because the first four nodes are directly relevant, providing information about the Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 and outlining legal protections, such as Stalking Protection Orders, and steps victims can take.  The fifth node, while mentioning the Act, lacks specific details on legal protections or actions for victims. The sixth node offers a broader context by discussing the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, but it is less directly relevant than the first four. The remaining nodes, focusing on commencement information, procedural aspects, and explanatory notes, are less relevant to the question of legal protections and safety measures for victims of stalking.",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because all sentences in the expected output are described within the retrieval context, with the details about the 'Protection from Stalking Act (NothernIreland) 2022' and the 'Stalking Protection Orders' in every sentence being directly supported by various nodes in retrieval context.",0.0,The score is 0.00 because the model's output perfectly aligns with the provided context without any contradictions.
