1.0,"The employee on maternity leave in England has various protections during a redundancy process. Here's a breakdown of the relevant legal considerations and how the employer should proceed: 

**Redundancy Protections under the Employment Rights Act 1996**

* **Right to be consulted:** The employer must consult with the employee about the redundancy, taking into account her maternity leave status. This consultation must be meaningful and involve discussing alternatives to redundancy, such as redeployment. 
* **Selection for redundancy:** The selection process must be fair and objective. The employer cannot discriminate against the employee based on her maternity leave status.  
* **Priority for redeployment:** The employee should be given priority for any suitable alternative roles within the company, even if they are not directly related to her previous role. 

**Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (as amended)**

* **Protection from dismissal:** The employee is protected from unfair dismissal during her maternity leave. Dismissal during this period is only permissible in exceptional circumstances, such as the complete closure of the business. 
* **Right to return to work:**  The employee has the right to return to her original job or a comparable position upon the end of her maternity leave, unless there are valid business reasons why this is not possible. 

**Equality Act 2010**

* **Discrimination:** The employer cannot discriminate against the employee based on her pregnancy or maternity leave status during the redundancy process. This includes any decisions related to selection, consultation, or redeployment. 

**Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999**

* **Safe workplace:**  The employer has a duty to ensure that the workplace is safe for all employees, including those on maternity leave. If there are health and safety concerns that could affect the employee's return to work, the employer must take steps to address them. 

**Employer's Procedures**

* **Open and transparent communication:** The employer must communicate openly and transparently with the employee throughout the redundancy process, taking into account her maternity leave status. 
* **Individual consultation:** The employer should conduct individual consultations with the employee, discussing her skills, experience, and potential redeployment options. 
* **Reasonable adjustments:** The employer may need to make reasonable adjustments to the workplace or the employee's role to accommodate her return to work after maternity leave, especially if there are health and safety concerns. 

**Case Law**

* **Relevant case law can provide guidance on the specific legal requirements and protections during redundancy, particularly for employees on maternity leave. This case law helps clarify the principles of fairness, non-discrimination, and reasonable adjustments in the context of redundancy.**

**Example Scenario**

Let's say the employee is a marketing manager and the company is restructuring its marketing department. The employer should first consult with the employee about the redundancy process, outlining the reasons for the restructure, the potential impact on her role, and exploring options for redeployment within the company. The employer should also consider if any adjustments are needed to ensure a safe return to work upon the completion of her maternity leave.

The PSNI will investigate the allegations and may take steps to protect the individual, such as issuing a restraining order or arresting the stalker.  The individual may also wish to seek legal advice from a solicitor to discuss their options and to explore any civil remedies that may be available to them. The individual should also ensure that they keep a detailed record of all incidents of harassment and stalking, including dates, times, locations, and any evidence such as text messages, emails, or voicemails.",0.9523809523809523,"The score is 0.95 because the actual output claims SPOs were introduced in October 2023, but the retrieval context states the Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, which makes provision for stalking protection orders, came into effect on April 26, 2022.",0.8041666666666667,"The score is 0.80 because the second node, 'This document is related to the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, not the Protection from Stalking Act (NorthernIreland) 2022.', is not related to the Stalking Act (NorthernIreland) 2022, while the remaining relevant nodes discuss essential elements in understanding legal protections under the Stalking Act (NorthernIreland) 2022, the purpose of Stalking Protection Orders, and procedures for applying for a stalking protection order.  The first node states that it defines 'acts associated with stalking' and 'risk associated with stalking', the third node explains the purpose of Stalking Protection Orders, and the fourth and fifth nodes provide the title and the enactment date of the Stalking Act, and the procedure for applying for a stalking protection order. Therefore, the second node should be ranked lower than the others.",0.8260869565217391,"The score is 0.83 because the retrieval context describes the Protection from Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, including definitions of stalking and associated risks, as well as the provisions for Stalking Protection Orders,  which aligns with sentences 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. The context provides information on the intent of the Act, outlining its aim to protect victims from stalking and provide early intervention.  However, there's no mention of 'severity' in the context, so sentence 13 is unsupportive. This results in a contextual recall score of 0.83.",0.0,"The score is 0.00 because the actual output aligns well with the provided context by discussing the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, Stalking Protection Orders, and their use in addressing stalking behaviors, all of which are present in the context."
