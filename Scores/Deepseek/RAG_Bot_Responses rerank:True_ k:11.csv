2. **Report to the local council:** If the landlord fails to respond or take appropriate action, the tenant can report the problem to the local council. The council will investigate the situation and may issue an Improvement Notice requiring the landlord to make repairs. 
3. **Seek legal advice:** The tenant can also seek legal advice from a solicitor to explore their legal options. This could include pursuing a court order requiring the landlord to make repairs. 
4. **Consider withholding rent:** In some cases, tenants may be able to withhold rent if the property is unfit for habitation, but this should be done with caution and only after consulting with a solicitor. 
5. **Seek assistance from a housing charity:** There are a number of housing charities in Scotland that can provide advice and support to tenants who are facing problems with their landlords.

Sentence 7 is partially supportive as the retrieval context mentions the employee's obligation to notify their employer but does not mention the employer's obligation to grant the leave.  The final sentence is unsupportive since it mentions the employee's right to statutory bereavement pay, which is not covered in the retrieval context. Overall, the retrieval context captures the essence of the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (NothernIreland) 2022, but does not include all the relevant information in the expected output.",0.8888888888888888,"The score is 0.89 because the output mentions the Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, which is a different piece of legislation compared to the one stated in the context, which refers to the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996.  The output also mentions the impact assessment was published in April 2020, contradicting the context which states the impact assessment was published on 14 May 2018.  The output doesn't specifically mention the revocation of regulations 14 and 115 as stated in the context, indicating further discrepancies. "
1.0,"The notice period is valid.  The tenant has a statutory right to a four-week notice period.  However, the tenant can still request a longer period from the landlord, and can argue that a four-week notice period is unreasonable in their circumstances. If the landlord refuses, the tenant can appeal to the Residential Tenancies Authority (RTA) to have the decision reviewed.  The tenant can also be entitled to seek legal advice to see if their landlord has given them adequate notice.",1.0,"This output is perfect! You did a great job, the 'actual output' is perfectly faithful to the 'retrieval context'!",0.8666666666666667,"The score is 0.87 because the first, second, and fifth nodes in retrieval contexts are relevant to the input, and the fourth node is irrelevant.  The fourth node is not relevant because it focuses on 'rent variation notices and contract-holder notices', which are unrelated to the given scenario of an eviction notice period based on tenancy duration. The first node is relevant as it mentions the 'Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022' which is relevant to the scenario.  The second node is relevant as it mentions Article 14 of the 2006 Order, which is central to the eviction notice period. The fifth node mentions Article 14 of the Private Tenancies (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 is about the length of notice to quit, which is directly relevant to the input case.",0.9166666666666666,"The score is 0.92 because the first sentence is about the 'Private Tenancies Act (NothernIreland) 2022', and the first node in retrieval context is about the 'Article 14 of the Private Tenancies (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 (length of notice to quit)', which is not directly mentioned in the first sentence but is mentioned in the next sentence, so the overall recall score is 0.92, reflecting near-perfect recall with a small miss on the first sentence.",0.8,"The hallucination score is 0.80 because the provided text only partially aligns with the context. While it discusses eviction notices and the Private Tenancies Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, it doesn't cover specific aspects mentioned in the context like rent variation notices, tenancies granted before the commencement date, or Landlord‚Äôs Notice Relating to the Variation of a Private Tenancy. This lack of specific details contributes to the high hallucination score."
1.0,"The individual in Northern Ireland can seek legal protection under the Stalking Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, which aims to protect victims from harassment and stalking. To ensure their safety, they should contact the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) to report the harassment and stalking.  They should also consider seeking a non-molestation order from the court, which can prohibit the ex-partner from contacting or approaching the individual.  The PSNI can also provide advice and support on how to stay safe, and the individual can also reach out to support organizations such as Women's Aid or the Victim Support Service for help and guidance. ",1.0,"This is amazing! The faithfulness score is 1.00, which is a perfect score.  There are no contradictions, so everything is perfect! üòÑ",0.8875,"The score is 0.89 because although the first node provides a general overview of stalking, the fourth node is more directly relevant as it defines the offense of stalking under the 2022 Act. Additionally, the fifth node explicitly highlights the protection orders available to victims, whereas the third node discusses a separate Act, making it less relevant. This indicates the ranking of the nodes is reasonably good, hence the high score.",1.0,The score is 1.00 because all the sentences in the expected output are covered by node(s) in retrieval context.,0.0,"The score is 0.00 because the output accurately reflects the information provided in the context, aligning with all statements without any contradictions. This indicates a complete understanding and adherence to the facts, resulting in a low hallucination score."
