(a)
the remedy (or remedies) sought could be granted by the appropriate tribunal, it must by order transfer the proceedings to the appropriate tribunal;

a party to the transaction has failed to execute the conveyance or lease, or
(ii)
the tenant has failed to pay the price and other sums payable, and
(d)
that failure is in breach of an obligation arising under this Part;

(2)
Where this section applies, the appropriate tribunal may, on the application of the tenant or the landlord, make an order—

appointing a person to execute the conveyance or lease on behalf of a party to the transaction;
(b)

After section 4A insert—
“4B
Meaning of “certified community housing provider”
(1)
For the purposes of this Part of this Act, a person is a “certified community housing provider” if the appropriate tribunal has issued a community housing certificate in respect of the person.
(2)
A community housing certificate is a certificate that the tribunal has determined that the person—
(a)
is a community land trust within the meaning of section 2(7A) of the Leasehold Reform (Ground Rent) Act 2022, or
(b)
is of a description, or satisfies conditions, specified for this purpose in regulations made by the Secretary of State.
(3)
The tribunal may issue a community housing certificate only in respect of a person that has made an application to the tribunal for the certificate.
(4)
The tribunal may cancel a community housing certificate—
(a)
on the application of the person in respect of which the certificate is issued, or

on the application of a tenant affected by the certificate, if the tribunal considers that—
(i)
the person in respect of which the certificate is issued does not fall within subsection (2)(a) or (b), or
(ii)
the certificate was obtained by deception or fraud.
For this purpose a tenant is “affected by” a certificate if, by virtue of section 1(1C), the tenant does not have the right to acquire the freehold because the certificate is issued in respect of their landlord.
(5)
The effect of the tribunal cancelling the certificate is that the person is not a certified community housing provider unless the tribunal issues a new community housing certificate.
(6)
The Secretary of State may by regulations provide for—
(a)
the procedure to be followed in connection with an application for a community housing certificate;
(b)
the procedure to be followed for the cancellation of a community housing certificate (including in connection with an application for the cancellation);
(c)
any matters to which the tribunal must have regard in deciding whether to issue or cancel a community housing certificate.
(7)
The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision about the application of this Part in circumstances where—
(a)
a landlord’s application for a community housing certificate has not been concluded when a tenant gives notice of their desire to have the freehold of a house and premises under this Part, or
(b)
a tenant’s claim to have the freehold of a house and premises under this Part has not been concluded when a landlord’s application for a community housing certificate is made.
(8)
Regulations under subsection (7) may in particular provide for—
(a)
the claim for the freehold to be paused or to have no effect;
(b)
a time period for the purposes of this Part to be extended in connection with the application;
(c)
the landlord to compensate a tenant or reversioner in respect of reasonable costs incurred in connection with a claim to acquire the freehold—
(i)
if the tenant ceases to have the right to acquire the freehold because of the issue of a certificate under this section, or
(ii)
if the costs are incurred as a result of the claim being suspended because of an application for a certificate under this section;
(d)
enforcement by the appropriate tribunal of any of the requirements of the regulations;
(e)
the appropriate tribunal to make orders that are supplementary to the issue of a community housing certificate.
(9)
Regulations under this section are to be made by statutory instrument.
(10)
A statutory instrument containing regulations under this section (whether alone or with other provision) may not be made unless a draft of the instrument has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, each House of Parliament.”

For the purposes of this Chapter, a person is a “certified community housing provider” if the appropriate tribunal has issued a community housing certificate in respect of the person.
(2)
A community housing certificate is a certificate that the tribunal has determined that the person—
(a)
is a community land trust within the meaning of section 2(7A) of the Leasehold Reform (Ground Rent) Act 2022, or

For this purpose a leaseholder is “affected by” a certificate if, by virtue of section 5(2)(aa), the leaseholder is not a qualifying tenant because the certificate is issued in respect of their immediate landlord.
(5)
The effect of the tribunal cancelling the certificate is that the person is not a certified community housing provider unless the tribunal issues a new community housing certificate.

the landlord to compensate the nominee purchaser, a tenant or a reversioner in respect of reasonable costs incurred in connection with a claim to exercise the right to collective enfranchisement—
(i)
if a person ceases to be a participating tenant because of the issue of a certificate under this section (and in this case the compensation may relate to reasonable costs for which the person is liable that are incurred after the person ceases to be a participating tenant),

(iii)
if the costs are incurred as a result of the claim being suspended because of an application for a certificate under this section;

enforcement by the appropriate tribunal of any of the requirements of the regulations;

(2)
This Part does not prejudice the operation of section 21 of the National Trust Act 1907, and accordingly a tenant does not have the right under this Part to acquire the freehold of inalienable National Trust property.
(3)
The right to an extended lease has effect subject to the following provisions of this section only if and to the extent that the existing tenancy demises inalienable National Trust property.

Lease extensions: the basis of the market value
3
(1)
This paragraph applies to a lease extension.
(2)
It must be assumed that—
(a)
the current lease will continue on the terms on which it is granted, and therefore will not be substituted by the statutory lease;
(b)
the current lease will continue (on those terms) until its term date;
(c)
a notional lease is granted out of the interest of the person granting the statutory lease;
(d)
the notional lease is subject to, and enjoys the benefit of, the current lease (and therefore enjoys the right to receive the rent payable under the current lease);
(e)
the term of the notional lease begins on the date for valuation;
(f)
subject to that, the terms of the notional lease are the same as the terms of the statutory lease that will be granted under the LRA 1967 or the LRHUDA 1993, including the peppercorn rent (and any other rent payable under a shared ownership lease in respect of the landlord’s share), the property demised, and the term expiring 990 years after the term date of the current lease.
(3)
But if the tenant is holding over under the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 at the valuation date—
(a)
in the assumption in sub-paragraph (2)(a), the reference to the terms on which the current lease is granted has effect as a reference to the terms on which the tenant is holding over under that Act;
(b)
the assumption in sub-paragraph (2)(b) does not apply.
(4)
Paragraph 21 makes provision about whether any right to hold over under the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 is to be taken into consideration in determining the market value of the notional lease (if the tenant is not holding over under that Act at the valuation date).
(5)
The market value is the amount which the notional lease could have been expected to realise if it had been sold on the open market by a willing seller at the valuation date.
(6)
In the following provisions of this Schedule, that market value is referred to as the market value of the notional lease.

Any determination of market value: specified matters to be taken into consideration
20
(1)
This paragraph applies if any specified matters arise in relation to newly owned premises.
(2)
The specified matters that arise must be taken into consideration when determining the market value of those premises.

must be taken into consideration.
(4)
In this paragraph “specified matters” means—
(a)
any defects in the title to the relevant freehold or statutory lease;
(b)
any property rights that burden or benefit the title to the relevant freehold or statutory lease;
(c)

Introduction
24

Step 1: determine the value of right to receive rent (the “term value”)
25
(1)
Step 1: determine the value of the right to receive rent over the remainder of the term of the current lease.
(2)
The “right to receive rent” is—
(a)
in the case of a freehold acquisition, the landlord’s right to receive the rent under the current lease;
(b)
in the case of a lease extension, the right of the tenant under the notional lease to receive the rent under the current lease.
Paragraph 26 contains provision about the rent that is to be used in step 1, including if and when a capped notional rent is to be used.
(3)
In the case of a collective enfranchisement, step 1 is to be followed separately in relation to each current lease.
(4)
In this Schedule the value determined under step 1 in relation to a lease is referred to as the “term value” of the lease.
(5)
Part 7 of this Schedule contains provision about the determination of the term value under this paragraph.
(6)
But, if there is no rent under a lease, or the rent under a lease is only a peppercorn rent, the term value of the lease is nil (and so sub-paragraph (5) does not apply).
(7)
If a current lease is a deemed single lease, step 1 is to be followed separately in relation to each constituent lease (as if the constituent lease were itself a current lease).
(8)
In this paragraph “rent” has the same meaning as in the LR(GR)A 2022 (see section 22(2) and (3) of that Act).

Rent (including a notional capped rent) that is to be used for determining the term value
26
(1)
The rent under the current lease must be used in step 1 to determine the lease’s term value.
(2)
If only some of the property demised by the current lease is subject to the standard valuation method, the rent under the lease that is attributable to that property must be used in step 1.
(3)
But, as respects any period when the notional annual rent for the current lease is lower than the actual annual rent, the notional annual rent must be used instead (and accordingly sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) are not to apply in relation to that period).
(4)
The “notional annual rent” for the current lease is an amount equivalent to 0.1% of the market value of the premises being valued.
(5)
The “premises being valued” are the premises that—
(a)
are demised by the current lease, and
(b)
are subject to the standard valuation method.
(6)
The “market value” of the premises being valued is—
(a)
in the case of a freehold enfranchisement, or lease extension, under the LRA 1967, the amount which the freehold of the premises being valued could have been expected to realise if it had been sold on the open market with vacant possession by a willing seller at the valuation date;
(b)
in the case of a collective enfranchisement or lease extension under the LRHUDA 1993, the share of the relevant freehold market value which is attributable to the premises being valued.
(7)
The “relevant freehold market value” is —
(a)
in the case of a collective enfranchisement, the amount which the freehold to be acquired on the collective enfranchisement could have been expected to realise if it had been sold on the open market with vacant possession by a willing seller at the valuation date;
(b)
in the case of a lease extension under the LRHUDA 1993, the amount which the freehold of the building and any other land which contain the premises being valued could have been expected to realise if it had been sold on the open market with vacant possession by a willing seller at the valuation date.
(8)
The “actual annual rent” is the rent referred to in sub-paragraph (1) or (2).
(9)
The notional annual rent must not be used in step 1 if—
(a)
no premium was payable on the grant of the current lease, or
(b)
the current lease was granted on the basis that—
(i)
the premium was lower, and the rent was higher, than each would otherwise have been, and
(ii)
the value of paying the lower premium was (at the time of the grant) broadly equivalent to, or greater than, the capitalised value of the extra rent.
(10)
It must be assumed that sub-paragraph (9)(b) is not applicable unless it is shown to be applicable.
(11)
If section 3(3) of the LRA 1967 applies to the current lease (successive leases treated as a single lease), sub-paragraph (9) is to apply only if the one of those leases which is in effect at the valuation date meets the condition in sub-paragraph (9)(a) or (b).
(12)
If the current lease is a shared ownership lease—
(a)
the rent that is to be used for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) and (2) is the rent that is payable under the lease in respect of the tenant’s share in the property demised by the lease;
(b)
where the lease does not reserve separate rents in respect of the tenant’s share in the demised premises and the landlord’s share in the property demised by the lease, any rent reserved is to be treated as reserved in respect of the landlord’s share.

Step 2 (freehold enfranchisement): determine the value of the freehold reversion (the “reversion value”)
27
(1)
This version of step 2 applies to freehold enfranchisements.
(2)
Step 2: for the newly owned premises which are subject to the standard valuation method (the “premises being valued”)—
(a)
determine the market value of those premises, and
(b)
then reduce that market value by using this formula:
where—
d is the applicable deferment rate;
n is the period (in years) that begins with the valuation date and ends at the end of the term of the current lease;
v is the market value.
(3)
The “market value” of the premises being valued is—
(a)
in the case of the transfer of a freehold house under the LRA 1967, the amount which the freehold of the premises being valued could have been expected to realise if it had been sold on the open market with vacant possession by a willing seller at the valuation date;
(b)
in the case of a collective enfranchisement, the share of the relevant freehold market value which is attributable to the premises being valued.
(4)
The “relevant freehold market value” is the amount which the freehold to be acquired on the collective enfranchisement could have been expected to realise if it had been sold on the open market with vacant possession by a willing seller at the valuation date.
(5)
In the case of a collective enfranchisement, step 2 is to be followed separately in relation to each part of the premises being valued that is subject to a different current lease.
(6)
In this Schedule the amount determined under step 2 in relation to the premises being valued, or a part of those premises, is referred to as the “reversion value” of the premises or part.
(7)
If a current lease is a deemed single lease, step 2 is to be followed separately in relation to each constituent lease (as if the constituent lease were itself a current lease).
(8)
In this paragraph “applicable deferment rate”, in relation to the determination of the reversion value of premises, means the deferment rate prescribed in regulations made by the Secretary of State that is applicable to that determination — and for this purpose a “deferment rate” is a rate applied to an anticipated future receipt to ascertain its value at an earlier date.
(9)
A statutory instrument containing regulations under this paragraph is subject to the negative procedure.
(10)
The Secretary of State must review the deferment rate or rates every ten years.

Step 2 (lease extensions): determine the value of a 990 year lease (the “reversion value”)
28
(1)
This version of step 2 applies to lease extensions.
(2)
Step 2: for the newly owned premises which are subject to the standard valuation method (the “premises being valued”)—
(a)
determine the market value of a lease of the premises being valued that is granted—
(i)
for a term of 990 years beginning with the date for valuation, and
(ii)
otherwise on the same terms as the statutory lease that will be granted under the LRA 1967 or the LRHUDA 1993, including the peppercorn rent and the property demised, and
(b)
then reduce that market value by using this formula:
where—
d is the applicable deferment rate;
n is the period (in years) that begins with the valuation date and ends at the end of the term of the current lease;
v is the market value.
(3)
The “market value” of the lease of the premises being valued is the amount which that lease could have been expected to realise if it had been sold on the open market with vacant possession by a willing seller at the valuation date.
(4)
If a current lease is a deemed single lease, step 2 is to be followed separately in relation to each constituent lease (as if the constituent lease were itself a current lease).
(5)
In this Schedule the amount determined under step 2 in relation to the premises being valued is referred to as the “reversion value” of those premises.
(6)
But if the current lease is a shared ownership lease—
(a)
the amount determined under step 2 must be multiplied by the tenant’s share in the premises being valued, and
(b)
the amount so calculated is the “reversion value” of the premises being valued.
(7)
In this paragraph “applicable deferment rate”, in relation to the determination of the reversion value of premises, means the deferment rate prescribed in regulations made by the Secretary of State that is applicable to that determination by virtue of the regulations — and for this purpose a “deferment rate” is a rate applied to an anticipated future receipt to ascertain its value at an earlier date.
(8)
A statutory instrument containing regulations under this section is subject to the negative procedure.

29
(1)
Step 3: add together—
(a)
the term value amount, and
(b)
the reversion value amount.
(2)
The “term value amount” is—
(a)
the term value determined under step 1 (if there is only one term value), or
(b)
the total of all the term values determined under step 1 (if there are two or more of them by virtue of paragraph 25(3) or (7)).

(4)
The amount calculated under step 3 (with any adjustment resulting from paragraph 20 or 22) is the market value of that property comprised in the relevant freehold or notional lease which is subject to the standard valuation method.

Lease subject to a rent review with fixed changes
37
(1)
This paragraph applies to a lease if the rent under the lease is subject to a rent review which provides that, over the unexpired term of the lease—
(a)
the rent will change each time one or more periods (a “review tranche”) begins,
(b)
the length of the review tranche, or each of them, is known at the valuation date (and, in a case where there are two or more review tranches, it does not matter if they are the same or different lengths), and
(c)
the amount by which the rent will change at the beginning of the review tranche, or each of them, is known or can be calculated at the valuation date (and, in a case where there are two or more review tranches, it does not matter if the amount of each change is the same or different).
(2)
The term value is the sum of—
(a)
the term value for the period (the “current tranche”) that begins with the valuation date and ends immediately before the start of the first (or only) review tranche after the valuation date, and
(b)
the term value or values for each (or the) subsequent review tranche.
(3)
The term value for the current tranche is determined using this formula—
where—
c is the applicable capitalisation rate;
r is the rent at the valuation date (but see sub-paragraph (4));
n is the length (in years) of the current tranche.
(4)
If paragraph 26(3) requires the notional annual rent to be used instead of the rent at the valuation date to determine the term value of the lease, r is the notional annual rent.
(5)
The term value for a review tranche (the “relevant review tranche”) is determined using this formula—
where—
c is the applicable capitalisation rate;
r is the rent during the relevant review tranche (but see sub-paragraph (6));
n is the length (in years) of the period that begins with the valuation date and ends with the day before the first day of the relevant review tranche.
t is the length (in years) of the relevant review tranche.
(6)
If paragraph 26(3) requires the notional annual rent to be used instead of the rent during the relevant review tranche to determine the term value of the lease, r is the notional annual rent.

Lease subject to any other rent review
38
(1)
This paragraph applies to a lease if—
(a)
the rent under the lease is subject to a rent review, and
(b)
paragraph 36 does not apply to the lease.
(2)
The term value is determined using this formula—
where—
c is the applicable capitalisation rate;
r1 is the rent at the valuation date (but see sub-paragraph (6));
r2 is the rent after the first rent review following the valuation date (but see sub-paragraph (6));
n1 is the length (in years) of the period during which the rent at the valuation date will be payable;
n2 is the length (in years) of the period that begins with the first day of the first rent review following the valuation date and ends with the term date of the current lease.
(3)
If the rent review provides for the rent under the lease to change by the same proportion as an index of price inflation or the capital or rental value of property, r2 is determined using this formula—
where—
a1 is the index of price inflation, or the capital or rental value, at the valuation date;
a2 is the index of price inflation, or the capital or rental value, at the time when the previous rent review took effect or (if none has taken effect) when the term of the lease began;
r1 is the rent at the valuation date;
(4)
If the rent review provides for the rent under the lease to be a percentage or other proportion of the capital value of property, r2 is determined using this formula—
where—
p is the percentage or other proportion;
v is the capital value of the property at the valuation date.
(5)
If neither sub-paragraph (3) nor (4) applies to the rent review, r2 is to be determined in line with the terms of the rent review provision.
(6)
If paragraph 26(3) requires the notional annual rent to be used—
(a)
instead of the rent at the valuation date to determine the term value of the lease, r1 is the notional annual rent;
(b)
instead of the rent after the first rent review following the valuation date, r2 is the notional annual rent.

(1)
In this Part of this Schedule—

“rent” has the same meaning as in the LR(GR)A 2022 (see section 22(2) and (3) of that Act);
“unexpired term”, in relation to a lease, means the period that—
(a)
begins with the valuation date, and
(b)
ends with the term date of the lease.

The buyer must pay a person (“P”) reasonable compensation for—
(a)
any diminution in value of any interest of P in other property resulting from the statutory transfer or grant, and
(b)
any other loss or damage which results from the statutory transfer or grant to the extent that it is referable to P’s ownership of any interest in other property.
(2)
Sub-paragraph (1)(b) includes loss of development value in relation to the newly owned premises to the extent that it is referable to P’s ownership of any interest in other property.
(3)
In the case of the collective enfranchisement of a building under the LRHUDA 1993, in determining the amount of compensation payable under this Schedule it is not material that—

loss or damage suffered by the freeholder could to any extent be avoided or reduced by the grant of a relevant leaseback to the freeholder, and
(b)
the freeholder is not requiring the nominee purchaser to grant a relevant leaseback.
(4)
In this paragraph—
“development value”, in relation to the newly owned premises, means any increase in the value of P’s interest in the premises which is attributable to the possibility of demolishing, reconstructing or carrying out substantial works of construction on, the whole or a substantial part of the premises;
“other property” means any property other than the newly owned premises;

(3)
For the purposes of this paragraph a lease is a “qualifying intermediate lease” if—
(a)
the lease demises the whole or a part of the house and premises,
(b)
the lease is immediately superior to—
(i)
the tenancy in possession, or
(ii)
one or more other leases that are themselves qualifying intermediate leases,
(c)
relevant rent is payable under the lease, and
(d)
that relevant rent is more than a peppercorn rent.
(4)
But any lease that must be surrendered under paragraph 11(1) is to be treated for the purposes of this paragraph as if it had been surrendered immediately before the relevant time.
(5)
The landlord or the tenant under a qualifying intermediate lease may, by giving notice to the reversioner and other landlords before the grant of the lease under section 14, require the rent payable under the qualifying intermediate lease to be reduced in accordance with sub-paragraphs (8) to (10).
(6)
If—
(a)
under sub-paragraph (5) the rent under a lease is required to be reduced in accordance with this paragraph, and
(b)
that lease is superior to one or more other qualifying intermediate leases,
the rent payable under the other qualifying intermediate lease or leases is also to be reduced in accordance with sub-paragraphs (8) to (10).
(7)
The landlord and tenant under a qualifying intermediate lease must vary the lease—
(a)
to give effect to a reduction of the rent in accordance with sub-paragraphs (8) to (10), and
(b)
to remove any terms of the lease which provide for an increase in the rent, or part of the rent, so reduced.
(8)
If the whole of the rent under a qualifying intermediate lease is relevant rent, the rent under that lease is to be reduced to a peppercorn rent.
(9)
If only part of the rent under a qualifying intermediate lease is relevant rent—
(a)
that part of the rent is to be reduced to zero, and
(b)
the total rent is to be reduced accordingly.
(10)
But the amount of the reduction in a person’s rental liabilities as tenant is limited to the amount of the reduction in that person’s rental income as landlord; and here—
(a)
“reduction in a person’s rental liabilities as tenant” means the reduction in accordance with sub-paragraph (8) or (9) of the rent payable by the person as tenant under the qualifying intermediate lease;
(b)
“reduction in that person’s rental income as landlord” means the amount (or total amount) of the relevant reduction (or reductions) in rent payable to that person as landlord of one or more other reduced rent leases.
(11)
In this paragraph—
“reduced rent lease” means—
(a)
the tenancy in possession, or
(b)
a qualifying intermediate lease;
“relevant reduction” means—
(a)
in relation to the tenancy in possession, a reduction resulting from that tenancy being substituted by the tenancy at a peppercorn rent granted under section 14;
(b)
in relation to a qualifying intermediate lease, a reduction resulting from this paragraph;
“relevant rent” means rent that has been, or would properly be, apportioned to the whole or a part of the house and premises.”

the existing lease, or
(ii)
one or more other leases that are themselves qualifying intermediate leases,

Meaning of “qualifying lease” and exclusion of certain rent from the right to vary
2
(1)
In this Schedule “qualifying lease” means—
(a)
a qualifying lease of a house, or
(b)
a qualifying lease of a flat.
(2)
But a lease is not a qualifying lease if—
(a)
the unexpired term of the lease is less than 150 years, or
(b)
the lease is an excepted lease for the purposes of the LR(GR)A 2022 under—
(i)
section 2(6) to (7B) of that Act (community housing leases), or
(ii)
section 2(8) to (11) of that Act (home finance plan leases).
(3)
A lease is a “qualifying lease of a house” for the purposes of this Schedule if the tenant—
(a)
is, by virtue of the lease, entitled to acquire an extended lease under the LRA 1967, or
(b)
is not so entitled, but only—
(i)
because a requirement in section 1 of the LRA 1967 for the tenancy to be at a low rent is not met,
(ii)
because a requirement in section 1(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the LRA 1967 for the house and premises or the tenancy to be above a certain value is not met, or
(iii)
by virtue of a Crown interest (see section 33 of that Act).
(4)
A lease is a “qualifying lease of a flat” for the purposes of this Schedule if the tenant—
(a)
is, by virtue of the lease, entitled to acquire an extended lease under the LRHUDA 1993, or
(b)
is not so entitled, but only by virtue of a Crown interest (see section 94 of that Act).
(5)
If only some of the property demised by a qualifying lease is qualifying property, the right to a peppercorn rent applies only in relation to so much of the rent which relates to the qualifying property (and, accordingly, any rent which relates to the other property demised by the qualifying lease is not affected by this Schedule).
(6)
For that purpose, property demised by a lease is “qualifying property” if the entitlement to acquire an extended lease referred to in sub-paragraph (3) or (4) does arise, or would arise (but for the impediment referred to in sub-paragraph (3)(b) or (4)(b)), in relation to that property by virtue of the qualifying lease.
(7)
If the qualifying lease is a shared ownership lease, the right to a peppercorn rent applies only in relation to rent payable in respect of the tenant’s share in the demised premises (and, accordingly, any rent which is payable in respect of the landlord’s share in the demised premises is not affected by this Schedule).
(8)
For that purpose, if the qualifying lease does not reserve separate rents in respect of the tenant’s share in the demised premises and the landlord’s share in the demised premises, any rent reserved is to be treated as reserved in respect of the landlord’s share.
(9)
In this paragraph—
(a)
“shared ownership lease” means a lease of premises—
(i)
granted on payment of a premium calculated by reference to a percentage of the value of the premises or of the cost of providing them, or
(ii)
under which the tenant (or the tenant’s personal representatives) will or may be entitled to a sum calculated by reference, directly or indirectly, to the value of the premises;
(b)
in relation to a shared ownership lease—
(i)
“tenant’s share” means the tenant’s initial share in the premises demised by the lease, plus any additional share or shares in those demised premises which the tenant has acquired;
(ii)
“landlord’s share” means the share in the premises demised by the lease which is not comprised in the tenant’s share.

3
(1)
A claim by a tenant to exercise the right to a peppercorn rent is made by the tenant giving notice of the claim (a “rent variation notice”) to—
(a)
the landlord under the qualifying lease, and
(b)
any other party to the qualifying lease.
(2)
But a rent variation notice is of no effect if it is given at a time when—
(a)
a lease extension notice,
(b)
a lease enfranchisement notice, or
(c)
another rent variation notice,
which relates to the qualifying lease has effect.
(3)
Paragraph 4 makes provision about the suspension of a rent variation notice.
(4)
A rent variation notice must state whether the right to a peppercorn rent applies—
(a)
to all of the rent under the qualifying lease, or
(b)
in accordance with paragraph 2(5), only to rent which relates to qualifying property demised by the qualifying lease.
(5)
If the notice states that the right applies only to rent which relates to qualifying property, the rent variation notice must also describe that qualifying property.
(6)
A rent variation notice must also specify—
(a)
the premium which the tenant is proposing to pay for the rent reduction, and
(b)
any other variations which need to be made to the lease in consequence of the reduction of the rent in accordance with this Schedule.
(7)
A rent variation notice—
(a)
is registrable under the Land Charges Act 1972, or
(b)
may be the subject of a notice under the Land Registration Act 2002,
as if it were an estate contract.
(8)
Where a rent variation notice is given, the rights and obligations of the tenant are assignable with, but are not capable of subsisting apart from, the qualifying lease or that lease so far as it demises qualifying property (see paragraph 2(5) and (6)); and, if the qualifying lease or that lease so far as it demises qualifying property is assigned—
(a)
with the benefit of the notice, any reference in this Schedule to the tenant is to be construed as a reference to the assignee;
(b)
without the benefit of the notice, the notice is to be deemed to have been withdrawn by the tenant as at the date of the assignment.
(9)
If a rent variation notice is the subject of a registration or notice of the kind mentioned in sub-paragraph (7), the notice is binding on—
(a)
any successor in title to the whole or part of the landlord’s interest under the qualifying lease, and
(b)
any person holding any interest granted out of the landlord’s interest;
and any reference in this Schedule to the landlord is to be construed accordingly.

before the end of the period for responding specified in the rent variation notice in accordance with paragraph 5(7), if a collective enfranchisement notice is current when a rent variation notice is given.
(7)
Where, as a result of the claim for collective enfranchisement ceasing to be current, the operation of the rent variation notice ceases to be suspended by virtue of this paragraph—
(a)
the landlord must, as soon as possible after becoming aware of the circumstances by virtue of which the claim for collective enfranchisement has ceased to be current, give the tenant a notice informing the tenant that the operation of the rent variation notice is no longer suspended as from the date when the claim for collective enfranchisement ceased to be current;
(b)

(b)
that, for reasons specified in the notice, the landlord does not admit that the tenant had that right on that date,
and which also specifies an address in England and Wales at which notices may be given to the landlord under this Schedule.

(4)
If the counter-notice admits the tenant’s right, the counter-notice must also state either—
(a)
that the landlord admits that the right applies to the rent in respect of which the right is claimed, or
(b)
that, for reasons specified in the notice, the landlord does not admit that the right applies to that rent,
and must also give the landlord’s response to the proposed premium, and any other consequential variations to the lease, specified in the rent variation notice in accordance with paragraph 3(6).
(5)

(b)
the rent which relates to the property described in the rent variation notice in accordance with paragraph 3(5), if it includes a statement under paragraph 3(4)(b).
(6)
If the counter-notice admits that the right applies to the rent in respect of which the right is claimed, the admission is binding on the landlord as to that rent, unless the landlord shows that misrepresentation or concealment of material facts induced the landlord to make the admission.
(7)
The “response period” is a period (for the landlord to give counter-notice) specified in the rent variation notice which begins with the day on which the notice is given.
(8)

Prospective
Reduction of rent under intermediate leases
8
(1)
This paragraph applies if, at the time when a rent variation notice is given, there are one or more qualifying intermediate leases.
(2)
For the purposes of this paragraph a lease is a “qualifying intermediate lease” if—
(a)
the lease demises the whole or a part of the property to which the rent variation notice relates,
(b)
the lease is immediately superior to—
(i)
the lease to which the rent variation notice relates, or
(ii)
one or more other leases that are themselves qualifying intermediate leases,
(c)
relevant rent is payable under the lease, and
(d)
that relevant rent is more than a peppercorn rent.
(3)
The landlord or the tenant under a qualifying intermediate lease may, by giving notice to the relevant landlord or landlords before the variation of the lease to which the rent variation notice relates, require the rent payable under the qualifying intermediate lease to be reduced in accordance with sub-paragraphs (6) to (8).
(4)
If—
(a)
under sub-paragraph (3) the rent under a lease is required to be reduced in accordance with this paragraph, and
(b)
that lease is superior to one or more other qualifying intermediate leases,
the rent payable under the other qualifying intermediate lease or leases is also to be reduced in accordance with sub-paragraphs (6) to (8).
(5)
The landlord and tenant under a qualifying intermediate lease must vary the lease—
(a)
to give effect to a reduction of the rent in accordance with sub-paragraphs (6) to (8), and
(b)
to remove any terms of the lease which provide for an increase in the rent, or part of the rent, so reduced.
(6)
If the whole of the rent under a qualifying intermediate lease is relevant rent, the rent under that lease is to be reduced to a peppercorn rent.
(7)
If only part of the rent under a qualifying intermediate lease is relevant rent—
(a)
that part of the rent is to be reduced to zero, and
(b)
the total rent is to be reduced accordingly.
(8)
But the amount of the reduction in a person’s rental liabilities as tenant is limited to the amount of the reduction in that person’s rental income as landlord; and here—
(a)
“reduction in a person’s rental liabilities as tenant” means the reduction in accordance with sub-paragraph (6) or (7) of the rent payable by the person as tenant under the qualifying intermediate lease;
(b)
“reduction in that person’s rental income as landlord” means the amount (or total amount) of the relevant reduction (or reductions) in rent payable to that person as landlord of one or more other reduced rent leases.
(9)
Each eligible landlord is entitled to be paid a share of the required premium (see paragraph 7).
(10)
An eligible landlord’s share of the required premium is to be determined using this formula—
where the loss suffered by an eligible landlord is the loss which that landlord suffers as a result of the relevant reduction in the rent of the lease by virtue of which they are an eligible landlord (taking into account any relevant reduction in the rent of a lease of which they are the tenant).
(11)
In this paragraph—
“eligible landlord” means the landlord of a lease whose rent is subject to a relevant reduction;
“reduced rent lease” means—
(a)
the lease to which the rent variation notice relates, or
(b)
a qualifying intermediate lease;
“relevant landlord” means—
(a)
the landlord under the qualifying lease, and
(b)
any superior landlord who must be given a copy of the rent variation notice in accordance with paragraph 16 or 17;
“relevant reduction” means—
(a)
in relation to the lease to which the rent variation notice relates, a reduction resulting from that tenancy being varied in accordance with the other provisions of this Schedule;
(b)
in relation to a qualifying intermediate lease, a reduction resulting from this paragraph;
“relevant rent” means rent that has been, or would properly be, apportioned to the whole or a part of the property to which the rent variation notice relates.
