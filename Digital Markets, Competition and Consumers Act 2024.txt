Interim enforcement orders
(1)
The CMA may make an enforcement order on an interim basis (an “interim enforcement order”) in relation to a suspected breach of a conduct requirement where—
(a)
the CMA has begun a conduct investigation in relation to the suspected breach, and
(b)
the CMA considers that it is necessary to act on an interim basis—

Commitments
(1)
The CMA may accept an appropriate commitment from an undertaking subject to a conduct investigation as to its behaviour in respect of a conduct requirement to which the investigation relates.
(2)
A commitment is appropriate where the CMA considers that compliance with the commitment by the undertaking would mean that it would not be necessary to carry out a conduct investigation so far as relating to the behaviour to which the commitment relates.
(3)
Following the acceptance of a commitment by the CMA as to the behaviour of an undertaking—
(a)
the undertaking that gave the commitment must comply with it at all times when it is in force, and
(b)
so far as relating to the behaviour, the CMA may not give a notice to the undertaking under section 30 (notice of findings).
(4)
The acceptance of a commitment does not prevent—
(a)
a conduct investigation from continuing so far as it relates to other behaviour in relation to the same or a different conduct requirement, or
(b)
the CMA beginning a new conduct investigation in relation to the behaviour to which the commitment relates where—
(i)
it has reasonable grounds to believe that there has been a material change of circumstances since the commitment was accepted,
(ii)
it has reasonable grounds to suspect that the undertaking has not complied with one or more of the terms of the commitment, or
(iii)
it has reasonable grounds to suspect that information which led it to accept the commitment was incomplete, false or misleading in a material particular.
(5)
A commitment under this section comes into force when a notice of its acceptance is published by the CMA.
(6)
A commitment under this section ceases to have effect—
(a)
subject to provision made in reliance on section 17 (existing obligations)—
(i)
in accordance with any terms of the commitment about when it is to cease to have effect, or
(ii)
when the conduct requirement to which the commitment relates ceases to have effect, or
(b)
when the undertaking is released from the requirement to comply with the commitment.
(7)
The CMA may by notice accept a variation to a commitment from time to time provided the commitment as varied would still be appropriate.
(8)
The CMA may release an undertaking from the requirement to comply with a commitment where it considers that it would be appropriate to do so.
(9)
The fact that a commitment ceases to have effect does not affect the exercise of any functions in relation to a breach or possible breach of that commitment.
(10)
Schedule 1 makes provision about—
(a)
accepting, or accepting a variation of, a commitment, and
(b)
releasing an undertaking from the requirement to comply with a commitment,

whether there are arrangements in place for the provision of mutual assistance as between the United Kingdom and that country or territory to whose authority the disclosure would be made in relation to the disclosure of information of the kind to which section 237 applies;

whether a person or body in that country or territory would assist the public authority in a way that corresponds or is substantially similar to the assistance that it is proposed the public authority give to the overseas public authority by making the disclosure.

(2)
The persons carrying on the enterprises concerned may make a fast-track reference request to the CMA at any time before the end of the initial period (whether or not that period has begun).
(3)
In this section and in sections 34ZE and 34ZF, “fast-track reference request” means a request that the CMA makes a reference under section 22(1A) or 33(1A) in relation to the arrangements concerned.
34ZE
Fast-track reference requests: procedure
(1)
This section applies where a fast-track reference request is made and not withdrawn.
(2)
Where the fast-track reference request is made before the beginning of the initial period, the CMA may, at any time before the beginning of that period, reject the request.
(3)
Where the CMA has not rejected the fast-track reference request in accordance with subsection (2), the CMA must, within the decision period, decide whether to accept the request in accordance with section 34ZF or reject the request.
(4)
Where the CMA accepts or rejects a fast-track reference request, the CMA must notify the persons carrying on the enterprises concerned that the request has been accepted or rejected.
(5)
In this section—
“decision period” means, in relation to the arrangements concerned—
(a)
in a case where the initial period has not begun, that period, or
(b)
in a case where the initial period has begun, the period beginning with the day on which the fast-track reference request is made and ending at the end of the initial period;
“initial period” has the meaning given by section 34ZA(3).
34ZF
Acceptance by the CMA of fast-track reference requests
(1)
The CMA may accept a fast-track reference request only if the condition in subsection (2) or (3) is met.
(2)
The condition in this subsection is that, in relation to the arrangements concerned—
(a)
the CMA believes that it is or may be the case that a relevant merger situation has been created, and
(b)
the CMA would not be prevented from making a reference under section 22(1) by reason of section 22(3).
(3)
The condition in this subsection is that, in relation to the arrangements concerned—
(a)
the CMA believes that it is or may be the case that, if carried into effect, the arrangements will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation, and
(b)
the CMA would not be prevented from making a reference under section 33(1) by reason of section 33(3).
(4)
In deciding whether to accept a fast-track reference request under subsection (2) or (3), the CMA must have regard, in particular, to—
(a)
whether the arrangements concerned raise any consideration specified in section 58;
(b)
whether a special intervention notice (see section 59(2)) is in force in relation to the arrangements.
(5)
Where the CMA decides to accept a fast-track reference request the duties to make references under sections 22(1) and 33(1) do not apply, and accordingly the CMA may not make any reference under those provisions in respect of the arrangements concerned (but see the duties under sections 22(1A) and 33(1A)).”

Part 2
Interpretation
Interpretation
3
This Part makes provision about the interpretation of this Schedule.
Joint interests
4
If a foreign power holds a share or right jointly with another person (whether or not a foreign power), each of those persons is to be taken to hold that share or right.
Joint arrangements
5
(1)
If shares or rights held by a foreign power and shares or rights held by another person (whether or not a foreign power) are the subject of a joint arrangement between those persons, each of those persons is to be taken to hold the combined shares or rights of both persons.
(2)
A “joint arrangement” is an arrangement between the holders of shares (or rights) that they will exercise all or substantially all the rights conferred by their respective shares (or rights) jointly in a way that is pre-determined by the arrangement.
(3)
For the meaning of “arrangement”, see paragraph 12.
Calculating shareholdings
6
(1)
In relation to a person that has a share capital, a reference to holding any of the shares in that person is to holding any shares comprised in the issued share capital of that person.
(2)
In relation to a person that does not have a share capital, a reference to holding any of the shares in that person is to holding a right to share to any extent in the capital or, as the case may be, profits of that person.
Voting rights
7
(1)
A reference to the voting rights in a person is to the rights conferred on shareholders in respect of their shares (or, in the case of a person not having a share capital, on members) to vote at general meetings of the person on all or substantially all matters.
(2)
In relation to a person that does not have general meetings at which matters are decided by the exercise of voting rights, a reference to exercising voting rights in the person is to be read as a reference to exercising rights in relation to the person that are equivalent to those of a person entitled to exercise voting rights in a company.
8
In applying this Schedule, voting rights in a person held by the person itself are to be disregarded.
Shares or rights held “indirectly”
9
(1)
A foreign power holds a share “indirectly” if the foreign power has any stake in a person and that person—
(a)
holds the share in question, or
(b)
is part of a chain of persons—
(i)
each of which (other than the last) has any stake in the person immediately below it in the chain, and
(ii)
the last of which holds the share.
(2)
A foreign power holds a right “indirectly” if the foreign power has any stake in a person and that person—
(a)
holds that right, or
(b)
is part of a chain of persons—
(i)
each of which (other than the last) has any stake in the person immediately below it in the chain, and
(ii)
the last of which holds that right.
(3)
For the purposes of sub-paragraphs (1) and (2), a person (“A”) has “any stake” in another person (“B”) if—
(a)
A holds any shares or voting rights in B,
(b)
A is a member of B and has the right to appoint or remove an officer of B,
(c)
A is a member of B and controls alone, or pursuant to an agreement with other shareholders or members, any of the voting rights in B, or
(d)
A has the right or ability to control or influence B to any extent, despite not being within paragraph (a), (b) or (c).
Shares held by nominees
10
A share held by a person as a nominee for another is to be treated as held by the other (and not by the nominee).
Rights treated as held by person who is able to control their exercise
11
(1)
Where a person controls a right, the right is to be treated as held by that person (and not by the person who in fact holds the right, unless that person also controls it).
(2)
A person “controls” a right if, by virtue of any arrangement between that person and others, the right is exercisable only—

where apart from the right to exercise them for the purpose of preserving the value of the security, or of realising it, the rights are exercisable only in accordance with that person’s instructions, and
(b)
where the shares are held in connection with the granting of loans as part of normal business activities and apart from the right to exercise them for the purpose of preserving the value of the security, or of realising it, the rights are exercisable only in that person’s interests.

(b)
to change (by increasing or decreasing) the proportion of shares or rights which is to be held by persons in a chain of persons for the purposes of determining whether shares or rights are held indirectly;

(e)
to change or supplement Part 1 of this Schedule so as to include circumstances (for example, circumstances involving more complex structures) that give a foreign power a level of control or influence in relation to the policy of a person broadly similar to the level of control or influence given by the conditions in paragraph 1;
(f)
in consequence of any provision made by virtue of paragraph (e), to change or supplement Part 2 of this Schedule so that circumstances specified in that Part in which a person is to be regarded as holding an interest in another person correspond to any of the conditions in paragraph 1, or would do so but for the extent of the interest.
(2)
The provision that may be made under this paragraph, read with section 124(2)(a), includes—
(a)
different provision for different descriptions of foreign power, and
(b)
different provision for different persons or descriptions of person in a chain of persons.

For section 154 (and the italic heading immediately before it) substitute—
“Undertakings in lieu
154A
Undertakings fully or partially in lieu of references or reports
(1)
This section applies where—
(a)
no market study notice has been published under section 130A but the CMA considers that it has the power to make a market investigation reference under section 131 and (subject to taking action under this section) intends to make such a reference,
(b)
a market study notice has been published under section 130A but no market investigation reference has been made under section 131, or
(c)
a market investigation reference has been made under section 131 or 132 but no report under section 136 has been published.
(2)
The CMA may accept, from such persons as it considers appropriate, undertakings to take such action as it considers appropriate for the purposes of remedying, mitigating or preventing (to any extent)—
(a)
any adverse effect on competition concerned, or
(b)
any detrimental effect on customers so far as—
(i)
it has resulted from the adverse effect on competition, or
(ii)
it may be expected to result from the adverse effect on competition.
(3)
An undertaking under this section is known as—
(a)
an “undertaking in lieu of a reference” where it is accepted in circumstances where this section applies by virtue of subsection (1)(a) or (b);
(b)
an “undertaking in lieu of a report” where it is accepted in circumstances where this section applies by virtue of subsection (1)(c).
(4)
The CMA may accept—
(a)
undertakings in lieu of a reference either—
(i)
instead of making a reference under section 131 (in which case the undertakings are known as “undertakings fully in lieu of a reference”), or
(ii)
in addition to making a reference under that section (in which case the undertakings are known as “undertakings partially in lieu of a reference”);
(b)
undertakings in lieu of a report either—
(i)
instead of publishing a report under section 136 (in which case the undertakings are known as “undertakings fully in lieu of a report”), or
(ii)
in addition to publishing a report under that section (in which case the undertakings are known as “undertakings partially in lieu of a report”).
(5)
In accepting undertakings fully in lieu of a reference or undertakings fully in lieu of a report, the CMA must, in particular, have regard to the need to achieve as comprehensive a solution as is reasonable and practicable to—
(a)
the adverse effect on competition concerned, and
(b)
any detrimental effects on customers so far as resulting from the adverse effect on competition.
(6)
In accepting an undertaking under this section, the CMA may, in particular, have regard to the effect of any action on any relevant customer benefits of the feature or features of the market or markets concerned.
(7)
Where no detrimental effect on customers has yet resulted from an adverse effect on competition, the CMA may not accept an undertaking under this section to remedy, mitigate or prevent a detrimental effect on customers so far as it may be expected to result from that adverse effect on competition unless the adverse effect on competition is also being remedied, mitigated or prevented (whether or not by the same undertaking).
(8)
An undertaking under this section—
(a)
comes into force when accepted;
(b)
may be varied or superseded by another undertaking;
(c)
may be released by the CMA.
(9)
The CMA must, as soon as reasonably practicable, consider any representations received by it in relation to varying or releasing an undertaking under this section.

This section is subject to sections 150 and 155.”

Accordingly, a report under section 136 is not required, and the duty under section 138 does not arise, if the CMA accepts an undertaking fully in lieu of a report.

(b)

Schedule 5 to CRA 2015 (investigatory powers) is amended as follows.
Commencement Information
I1
Sch. 17 para. 1 not in force at Royal Assent, see s. 339(1)
Penalties for non-compliance with information notices
2
(1)
Paragraph 15 is amended in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) and (3).
(2)
In sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
in the opening words for “may” substitute “must”;
(b)
after paragraph (b) insert—
“(c)
the circumstances in which a monetary penalty may be payable under this Part of this Schedule in relation to non-compliance with the notice.”
(3)
After paragraph 16 insert—
“Non-compliance with notice under paragraph 14: power of court to impose monetary penalties
16A
(1)
This paragraph applies where—
(a)
an enforcer or an officer of an enforcer has given a notice to a person (“the respondent”) under paragraph 14, and
(b)
the enforcer considers that the respondent has, without reasonable excuse, failed to comply with the notice.
(2)
The enforcer or an officer of the enforcer may make an application under this paragraph to the court.
(3)
If the court finds that the respondent has, without reasonable excuse, failed to comply with the notice, the court may make an order that requires the respondent to pay a monetary penalty to the enforcer.
(4)
The amount of the penalty must be—
(a)
a fixed amount,
(b)
an amount calculated by reference to a daily rate, or
(c)
a combination of a fixed amount and an amount calculated by reference to a daily rate.
(5)
The penalty must not exceed—
(a)
in the case of a fixed amount, £30,000 or, if higher, 1% of the total value of the turnover (if any) of the respondent;
(b)
in the case of an amount calculated by reference to a daily rate, £15,000 per day or, if higher, 5% of the total value of the daily turnover (if any) of the respondent;
(c)
in the case of a fixed amount and an amount calculated by reference to a daily rate, such fixed amount and such amount per day.
(6)
In imposing a penalty by reference to a daily rate—
(a)
no account is to be taken of any days before the notification date, and
(b)
unless the court determines an earlier date (whether before or after the order imposing the penalty is made), the amount payable ceases to accumulate on the day on which the requirements of the notice under paragraph 14 are complied with.
(7)
An order under this paragraph, or a notice accompanying service of the order, must state—
(a)
the amount of the penalty (including whether it is a fixed amount, an amount calculated by reference to a daily rate or both a fixed amount and an amount calculated by reference to a daily rate);
(b)
the grounds on which the penalty is imposed together with any other factors that the court considers justify the giving of the penalty or its amount;
(c)
in the case of an amount calculated by reference to a daily rate, the day on which the amount first starts to accumulate and the day or days on which it might cease to accumulate;
(d)
how the penalty is to be paid to the enforcer;
(e)
the date or dates, no earlier than the end of 28 days beginning with the date of service of the order on the respondent, by which the penalty or (as the case may be) different portions of it are required to be paid;
(f)
that the penalty or (as the case may be) different portions of it may be paid earlier than the date or dates by which it or they are required to be paid;
(g)
that the respondent has the right to apply under sub-paragraph (8), and the rights available to the respondent to appeal against the order, and the main details of those rights.
(8)
The respondent may, within 14 days of the date on which an order under this paragraph is served on the respondent, apply to the court for it to specify a different date or dates by which the penalty, or portions of it, are to be paid.
(9)
An application by an enforcer or officer of an enforcer under this paragraph—
(a)
may be made in addition to, or instead of, an application under paragraph 16, and
(b)
where made in addition to an application under paragraph 16, may be combined with the application under that paragraph.
(10)
In addition to any right of appeal on a point of law, a person liable to pay a penalty by virtue of an order under this paragraph may appeal in respect of the amount of the penalty.
(11)
Where an appeal is brought in respect of a penalty imposed by virtue of an order under this paragraph, the penalty is not payable until the appeal is determined or withdrawn, unless the court dealing with the appeal orders otherwise.
(12)
Sub-paragraphs (4) and (5) of paragraph 16 apply to an order under this paragraph as they apply to an order under that paragraph.
(13)
In the application of this paragraph to Scotland, the references in sub-paragraphs (7) and (8) to an order being served include service of an extract order in execution of or diligence on the order.
(14)
In this paragraph, other than in sub-paragraph (11)—
“the court” has the same meaning as in paragraph 16;
“the notification date”, in relation to an order under this paragraph, means the date on which notice of the application for the order is given to the respondent.
Non-compliance with notice under paragraph 14: powers of CMA to give provisional enforcement notice
16B
(1)
This paragraph applies where—
(a)
the CMA has given a notice to a person (“the respondent”) under paragraph 14, and
(b)
the CMA has reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent has failed to comply with the notice.
(2)
The CMA may give to the respondent a notice under this paragraph (a “provisional enforcement notice”).
(3)
A provisional enforcement notice must—
(a)
set out the grounds on which it is given, including the respondent’s acts or omissions giving rise to the giving of the notice;
(b)

(b)
for the purposes of the taking of enforcement action relating to a breach of an order made by, or undertaking given to, the court under the old law;

I2
Sch. 19 para. 2 not in force at Royal Assent, see s. 339(1)
Rules applicable to continuing conduct
3
(1)
This paragraph applies where conduct of a person is continuing conduct.
(2)
The new law applies in respect of the person’s post-commencement conduct.
(3)
The new law also applies in respect of the person’s pre-commencement conduct for the purposes of enabling the taking of enforcement action under Chapter 3 or 4 of Part 3 in relation to that conduct.
(4)
Where the new law applies by virtue of sub-paragraph (3), a requirement under Chapter 3 or (as the case may be) Chapter 4 may be imposed on a person in respect of the relevant infringement in relation to which the enforcement action is taken only if a requirement of a corresponding kind could have been imposed on the person under the old law (and accordingly a monetary penalty, in particular, may not be imposed on the person).
(5)
In applying the new law in accordance with this paragraph in respect of a person’s post-commencement conduct, regard may be had to, and findings of fact or law may be made in respect of, the person’s pre-commencement conduct so far as necessary or appropriate for the purposes of determining any matter that falls to be determined in the application of the new law.
(6)
In this paragraph—
“post commencement conduct” means so much of a person’s continuing conduct as takes place on or after the commencement date;
“pre-commencement conduct” means so much of a person’s continuing conduct as takes place before the commencement date.

Enforcement action in respect of a person’s breach of the undertaking, whether the breach takes place before, on or after the commencement date, may be taken only under the old law.
(3)
Sub-paragraph (4) applies where a breach of the undertaking—
(a)
takes place (to any extent) on or after the commencement date, and
(b)
it appears to an enforcer that the act or omission comprising the breach, so far as taking place on or after that date—
(i)
is also a commercial practice which constitutes a relevant infringement under the new law, or
(ii)
is carried out by a person who is an accessory under the new law to such a commercial practice.
(4)
Enforcement action in respect of the act or omission may be taken—
(a)
under the new law, or
(b)
if the act or omission would also be a domestic or Schedule 13 infringement for the purposes of the old law, under the old law.
(5)
It is for the enforcer concerned to determine whether to take enforcement action under the new law or the old law in accordance with sub-paragraph (4).
(6)
A breach of an undertaking that first takes place before the commencement date is to be treated for the purposes of this paragraph as also taking place on or after that date if the act or omission comprising the breach is repeated or continued on or after that date.
